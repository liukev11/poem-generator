    "The purpose of this project is to generate a piece of poetry which falls under a similar style to that of Edgar Allen Poe and William Shakespeare. My initial expectations are that the poem output will be garbled at first, especially with a lower epoch count, but will initially become more comprehensible as epochs increase and we include dropout. We will be using a LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) RNN model, as it fits the purpose of the project. Using LSTM allows the model to remember import textual aspects, and forget unnecessary components. We are also using character-level generation as opposed to word-level, mainly due to lack of computational resources."

       "'the raven.  once upon a midnight dreary, while i pondered, weak and weary,  over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore  while i nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,  as of some one gently rappingrapping at my chamber door.  \"tis some visitor,\" i muttered, \"tapping at my chamber door          only this and nothing more.\"  ah, distinctly i remember, it was in the bleak december,  and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.  eagerly i wished the morrow;vainly i had sought to borrow  from my books surcease of sorrowsorrow for the lost lenore  for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore          nameless here for evermore.  and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain  thrilled mefilled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;  so that now, to still the beating of my heart, i stood repeating  \"tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door  some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;      this it is and nothing more.\"  presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,  \"sir,\" said i, \"or madam, truly your forgiveness i implore;  but the fact is i was napping, and so gently you came rapping,  and so faintly you came tappingtapping at my chamber door,  that i scarce was sure i heard you\"here i opened wide the door        darkness there and nothing more.  deep into that darkness peering, long i stood there wondering,    fearing,  doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;  but the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,  and the only word there spoken was the whispered word, \"lenore!\"  this i whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, \"lenore!\"        merely this and nothing more.  back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,  soon i heard again a tapping, somewhat louder than before.  \"surely,\" said i, \"surely that is something at my window lattice;  let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore  let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore;      tis the wind and nothing more.\"  open here i flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,  in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;  not the least obeisance made he not an instant stopped or stayed he;  but, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door  perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door      perched, and sat, and nothing more.  then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,  by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,  \"though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\" i said, \"art sure no    craven,  ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore  tell me what thy lordly name is on the nights plutonian shore!\"        quoth the raven, \"nevermore.\"  much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,  though its answer little meaninglittle relevancy bore;  for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being  ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door  bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,        with such name as \"nevermore.\"  but the raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only  that one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.  nothing further then he utterednot a feather then he fluttered  till i scarcely more than muttered, \"other friends have flown before  on the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.\"        then the bird said, \"nevermore.\"  startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,  \"doubtless,\" said i, \"what it utters is its only stock and store,  caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster  followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore  till the dirges of his hope the melancholy burden bore      of nevernevermore.\"  but the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,  straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and    door;  then, upon the velvet sinking, i betook myself to linking  fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore  what this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore      meant in croaking \"nevermore.\"  this i sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing  to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosoms core;  this and more i sat divining, with my head at ease reclining  on the cushions velvet lining that the lamplight gloated oer,  but whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating oer,        she shall press, ah, nevermore!  then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer  swung by seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.  \"wretch,\" i cried, \"thy god hath lent theeby these angels he hath    sent thee  respiterespite aad nepenth from thy memories of lenore!  quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenth, and forget this lost lenore!\"        quoth the raven, \"nevermore.\"  \"prophet!\" said i, \"thing of evil!prophet still, if bird or devil!  whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,  desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted  on this home by horror hauntedtell me truly, i implore  is thereis there balm in gilead?tell metell me, i implore!\"      quoth the raven, \"nevermore.\"  \"prophet!\" said i, \"thing of evil!prophet still, if bird or devil!  by that heaven that bends above usby that god we both adore  tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant aidenn,  it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name lenore  clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore.\"        quoth the raven, \"nevermore.\"  \"be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!\" i shrieked,    upstarting  \"get thee back into the tempest and the nights plutonian shore!  leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!  leave my loneliness unbroken!quit the bust above my door!  take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!\"      quoth the raven, \"nevermore.\"  and the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting  on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door;  and his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming,  and the lamplight oer him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;  and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor      shall be liftednevermore!the bells,i.  hear the sledges with the bells  silver bells!  what a world of merriment their melody foretells!  how they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,  in their icy air of night!  while the stars, that oversprinkle  all the heavens, seem to twinkle  with a crystalline delight;  keeping time, time, time,  in a sort of runic rhyme,  to the tintinnabulation that so musically wells  from the bells, bells, bells, bells,  bells, bells, bells  from the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.ii.  hear the mellow wedding bells,  golden bells!  what a world of happiness their harmony foretells!  through the balmy air of night  how they ring out their delight!  from the molten goldennotes,  and all in tune,  what a liquid ditty floats  to the turtledove that listens, while she gloats  on the moon!  oh, from out the sounding cells,  what a gush of euphony voluminously wells!  how it swells!  how it dwells  on the future! how it tells  of the rapture that impels  to the swinging and the ringing  of the bells, bells, bells,  of the bells, bells, bells, bells,  bells, bells, bells  to the rhyming and the chiming of the bells!iii.  hear the loud alarum bells  brazen bells!  what a tale of terror now their turbulency tells!  in the startled ear of night  how they scream out their affright!  too much horrified to speak,  they can only shriek, shriek,  out of tune,  in a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,  in a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire  leaping higher, higher, higher,  with a desperate desire,  and a resolute endeavor  nownow to sit or never,  by the side of the palefaced moon.  oh, the bells, bells, bells!  what a tale their terror tells  of despair!  how they clang, and clash, and roar!  what a horror they outpour  on the bosom of the palpitating air!  yet the ear it fully knows,  by the twanging,  and the clanging,  how the danger ebbs and flows;  yet the ear distinctly tells,  in the jangling,  and the wrangling,  how the danger sinks and swells,  by the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells  of the bells  of the bells, bells, bells, bells,  bells, bells, bells  in the clamor and the clangor of the bells!iv.  hear the tolling of the bells  iron bells!  what a world of solemn thought their monody compels!  in the silence of the night,  how we shiver with affright  at the melancholy menace of their tone!  for every sound that floats  from the rust within their throats     is a groan.  and the peopleah, the people  they that dwell up in the steeple.      all alone,  and who toiling, toiling, toiling,    in that muffled monotone,  feel a glory in so rolling    on the human heart a stone  they are neither man nor woman  they are neither brute nor human      they are ghouls  and their king it is who tolls;  and he rolls, rolls, rolls,           rolls  a pan from the bells!  and his merry bosom swells  with the pan of the bells!  and he dances, and he yells;  keeping time, time, time,  in a sort of runic rhyme,  to the pan of the bells      of the bells  keeping time, time, time,  in a sort of runic rhyme,    to the throbbing of the bells  of the bells, bells, bells    to the sobbing of the bells;  keeping time, time, time,    as he knells, knells, knells,  in a happy runic rhyme,  to the rolling of the bells  of the bells, bells, bells  to the tolling of the bells,  of the bells, bells, bells, bells,    bells, bells, bells  to the moaning and the groaning of the bells.ulalume.  the skies they were ashen and sober;    the leaves they were crisped and sere    the leaves they were withering and sere;  it was night in the lonesome october    of my most immemorial year;  it was hard by the dim lake of auber,    in the misty mid region of weir  it was down by the dank tarn of auber,    in the ghoulhaunted woodland of weir.  here once, through an alley titanic.    of cypress, i roamed with my soul    of cypress, with psyche, my soul.  these were days when my heart was volcanic    as the scoriac rivers that roll    as the lavas that restlessly roll  their sulphurous currents down yaanek    in the ultimate climes of the pole  that groan as they roll down mount yaanek    in the realms of the boreal pole.  our talk had been serious and sober,    but our thoughts they were palsied and sere    our memories were treacherous and sere  for we knew not the month was october,  and we marked not the night of the year    (ah, night of all nights in the year!)  we noted not the dim lake of auber    (though once we had journeyed down here)  remembered not the dank tarn of auber,    nor the ghoulhaunted woodland of weir.  and now as the night was senescent    and stardials pointed to morn    as the sundials hinted of morn  at the end of our path a liquescent    and nebulous lustre was born,  out of which a miraculous crescent    arose with a duplicate horn  astartes bediamonded crescent    distinct with its duplicate horn.  and i said\"she is warmer than dian    she rolls through an ether of sighs    she revels in a region of sighs  she has seen that the tears are not dry on    these cheeks, where the worm never dies,  and has come past the stars of the lion    to point us the path to the skies    to the lethean peace of the skies  come up, in despite of the lion,    to shine on us with her bright eyes  come up through the lair of the lion,    with love in her luminous eyes.\"  but psyche, uplifting her finger,    said\"sadly this star i mistrust    her pallor i strangely mistrust  oh, hasten!oh, let us not linger!    oh, fly!let us fly!for we must.\"  in terror she spoke, letting sink her    wings till they trailed in the dust  in agony sobbed, letting sink her    plumes till they trailed in the dust    till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.  i replied\"this is nothing but dreaming    let us on by this tremulous light!    let us bathe in this crystalline light!  its sibyllic splendor is beaming    with hope and in beauty tonight    see!it flickers up the sky through the night!  ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,    and be sure it will lead us aright  we safely may trust to a gleaming    that cannot but guide us aright,    since it flickers up to heaven through the night.\"  thus i pacified psyche and kissed her,    and tempted her out of her gloom    and conquered her scruples and gloom;  and we passed to the end of a vista,    but were stopped by the door of a tomb    by the door of a legended tomb;  and i said\"what is written, sweet sister,    on the door of this legended tomb?\"    she replied\"ulalumeulalume    tis the vault of thy lost ulalume!\"  then my heart it grew ashen and sober    as the leaves that were crisped and sere    as the leaves that were withering and sere;  and i cried\"it was surely october    on this very night of last year    that i journeyedi journeyed down here    that i brought a dread burden down here!

 was it not fate, that, on this july midnight  was it not fate (whose name is also sorrow),  that bade me pause before that gardengate,  to breathe the incense of those slumbering roses?  no footstep stirred the hated world all slept,  save only thee and me(o heaven!o god!  how my heart beats in coupling those two words!)  save only thee and me. i pausedi looked  and in an instant all things disappeared.  (ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!)  the pearly lustre of the moon went out  the mossy banks and the meandering paths,  the happy flowers and the repining trees,  were seen no more the very roses odors  died in the arms of the adoring airs.  allall expired save theesave less than thou  save only the divine light in thine eyes  save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes.  i saw but themthey were the world to me.  i saw but themsaw only them for hours  saw only them until the moon went down.  what wild hearthistories seemed to lie unwritten  upon those crystalline, celestial spheres!  how dark a woe! yet how sublime a hope!  how silently serene a sea of pride!  how daring an ambition! yet how deep  how fathomless a capacity for love!  but now, at length, dear dian sank from sight,  into a western couch of thundercloud;  and thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees  didst glide away. only thine eyes remained.  they would not gothey never yet have gone.  lighting my lonely pathway home that night,  they have not left me (as my hopes have) since.  they follow methey lead me through the years.  they are my ministersyet i their slave.  their office is to illumine and enkindle  my duty, to be saved by their bright light,  and purified in their electric fire,  and sanctified in their elysian fire.  they fill my soul with beauty (which is hope),  and are far up in heaventhe stars i kneel to  in the sad, silent watches of my night;  while even in the meridian glare of day  i see them stilltwo sweetly scintillant  venuses, unextinguished by the sun!annabel lee.  it was many and many a year ago,    in a kingdom by the sea,  that a maiden there lived whom you may know    by the name of annabel lee;  and this maiden she lived with no other thought    than to love and be loved by me.  i was a child and she was a child,    in this kingdom by the sea  but we loved with a love that was more than love    i and my annabel lee;  with a love that the winged seraphs of heaven    coveted her and me.  and this was the reason that, long ago,    in this kingdom by the sea,  a wind blew out of a cloud, chilling    my beautiful annabel lee;  so that her highborn kinsmen came    and bore her away from me,  to shut her up in a sepulchre    in this kingdom by the sea.  the angels, not half so happy in heaven,    went envying her and me  yes!that was the reason (as all men know,    in this kingdom by the sea)  that the wind came out of the cloud by night,    chilling and killing my annabel lee.  but our love it was stronger by far than the love    of those who were older than we    of many far wiser than we  and neither the angels in heaven above,    nor the demons down under the sea,  can ever dissever my soul from the soul    of the beautiful annabel lee.  for the moon never beams without bringing me dreams    of the beautiful annabel lee;  and the stars never rise but i see the bright eyes    of the beautiful annabel lee;  and so, all the nighttide, i lie down by the side  of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride,    in her sepulchre there by the sea    in her tomb by the side of the sea.a valentine.  for her this rhyme is penned, whose luminous eyes,    brightly expressive as the twins of leda,  shall find her own sweet name, that, nestling lies    upon the page, enwrapped from every reader.  search narrowly the lines!they hold a treasure    divinea talismanan amulet  that must be worn at heart. search well the measure    the wordsthe syllables!

eidolon, named night,  on a black throne reigns upright,  i have reached these lands but newly  from an ultimate dim thule  from a wild weird clime that lieth, sublime,    out of spaceout of time.  bottomless vales and boundless floods,  and chasms, and caves, and titan woods,  with forms that no man can discover  for the dews that drip all over;  mountains toppling evermore  into seas without a shore;  seas that restlessly aspire,  surging, unto skies of fire;  lakes that endlessly outspread  their lone waterslone and dead,  their still watersstill and chilly  with the snows of the lolling lily.  by the lakes that thus outspread  their lone waters, lone and dead,  their sad waters, sad and chilly  with the snows of the lolling lily,  by the mountainsnear the river  murmuring lowly, murmuring ever,  by the gray woods,by the swamp  where the toad and the newt encamp,  by the dismal tarns and pools    where dwell the ghouls,  by each spot the most unholy  in each nook most melancholy,  there the traveller meets aghast  sheeted memories of the past  shrouded forms that start and sigh  as they pass the wanderer by  whiterobed forms of friends long given,  in agony, to the earthand heaven.  for the heart whose woes are legion  tis a peaceful, soothing region  for the spirit that walks in shadow  tisoh, tis an eldorado!  but the traveller, travelling through it,  may

poetical the critic, the less justthe critique, and the converse. on this account, and because there arebut few bs in the world, i would be as much ashamed of the worldsgood opinion as proud of your own. another than yourself might hereobserve, shakespeare is in possession of the worlds good opinion, andyet shakespeare is the greatest of poets. it appears then that the worldjudge correctly, why should you be ashamed of their favorable judgment?the difficulty lies in the interpretation of the word judgment oropinion. the opinion is the worlds, truly, but it may be calledtheirs as a man would call a book his, having bought it; he did notwrite the book, but it is his; they did not originate the opinion, butit is theirs. a fool, for example, thinks shakespeare a great poetyetthe fool has never read shakespeare. but the fools neighbor, who is astep higher on the andes of the mind, whose head (that is to say, hismore exalted thought) is too far above the fool to be seen orunderstood, but whose feet (by which i mean his everyday actions) aresufficiently near to be discerned, and by means of which thatsuperiority is ascertained, which but for them would never have beendiscoveredthis neighbor asserts that shakespeare is a great poetthefool believes him, and it is henceforward his opinion. this neighborsown opinion has, in like manner, been adopted from one above him, andso, ascendingly, to a few gifted individuals who kneel around thesummit, beholding, face to face, the master spirit who stands upon thepinnacle.\"you are aware of the great barrier in the path of an american writer.he is read, if at all, in preference to the combined and established witof the world. i say established; for it is with literature as with lawor empirean established name is an estate in tenure, or a throne inpossession. besides, one might suppose that books, like their authors,improve by traveltheir having crossed the sea is, with us, so great adistinction. our antiquaries abandon time for distance; our very fopsglance from the binding to the bottom of the titlepage, where themystic characters which spell london, paris, or genoa, are precisely somany letters of recommendation.\"i mentioned just now a vulgar error as regards criticism. i think thenotion that no poet can form a correct estimate of his own writings isanother. i remarked before that in proportion to the poetical talentwould be the justice of a critique upon poetry. therefore a bad poetwould, i grant, make a false critique, and his selflove wouldinfallibly bias his little judgment in his favor; but a poet, who isindeed a poet, could not, i think, fail of making a just critique;whatever should be deducted on the score of selflove might be replacedon account of his intimate acquaintance with the subject; in short, wehave more instances of false criticism than of just where ones ownwritings are the test, simply because we have more bad poets than good.there are, of course, many objections to what i say milton is a greatexample of the contrary; but his opinion with respect to the paradiseregained is by no means fairly ascertained. by what trivialcircumstances men are often led to assert what they do not reallybelieve! perhaps an inadvertent word has descended to posterity. but, infact, the paradise regained is little, if at all, inferior to theparadise lost, and is only supposed so to be because men do not likeepics, whatever they may say to the contrary, and reading those ofmilton in their natural order, are too much wearied with the first toderive any pleasure from the second.\"i dare say milton preferred comus to eitherif sojustly.\"as i am speaking of poetry, it will not be amiss to touch slightly uponthe most singular heresy in its modern historythe heresy of what iscalled, very foolishly, the lake school. some years ago i might havebeen induced, by an occasion like the present, to attempt a formalrefutation of their doctrine; at present it would be a work ofsupererogation. the wise must bow to the wisdom of such men as coleridgeand southey, but being wise, have laughed at poetical theories soprosaically exemplified.\"aristotle, with singular assurance, has declared poetry the mostphilosophical of all writingsbut it required a wordsworth to pronounceit the most metaphysical. he seems to think that the end of poetry is,or should be, instruction; yet it is a truism that the end of ourexistence is happiness; if so, the end of every separate part of ourexistence, everything connected with our existence, should be stillhappiness. therefore the end of instruction should be happiness; andhappiness is another name for pleasure;therefore the end ofinstruction should be pleasure yet we see the abovementioned opinionimplies precisely the reverse.\"to proceed ceteris paribus, he who pleases is of more importance tohis fellowmen than he who instructs, since utility is happiness, andpleasure is the end already obtained which instruction is merely themeans of obtaining.\"i see no reason, then, why our metaphysical poets should plumethemselves so much on the utility of their works, unless indeed theyrefer to instruction with eternity in view; in which case, sincererespect for their piety would not allow me to express my contempt fortheir judgment; contempt which it would be difficult to conceal, sincetheir writings are professedly to be understood by the few, and it isthe many who stand in need of salvation. in such case i should no doubtbe tempted to think of the devil in melmoth, who labors indefatigably,through three octavo volumes, to accomplish the destruction of one ortwo souls, while any common devil would have demolished one or twothousand.\"against the subtleties which would make poetry a studynot apassionit becomes the metaphysician to reasonbut the poet toprotest. yet wordsworth and coleridge are men in years; the one imbuedin contemplation from his childhood; the other a giant in intellect andlearning. the diffidence, then, with which i venture to dispute theirauthority would be overwhelming did i not feel, from the bottom of myheart, that learning has little to do with the imaginationintellectwith the passionsor age with poetry.  \"trifles, like straws, upon the surface flow;  he who would search for pearls must dive below,\"are lines which have done much mischief. as regards the greater truths,men oftener err by seeking them at the bottom than at the top; truthlies in the huge abysses where wisdom is soughtnot in the palpablepalaces where she is found. the ancients were not always right in hidingthe goddess in a well; witness the light which bacon has thrown uponphilosophy; witness the principles of our divine faiththat moralmechanism by which the simplicity of a child may overbalance the wisdomof a man.\"we see an instance of coleridges liability to err, in his biographialiterariaprofessedly his literary life and opinions, but, in fact, atreatise de omni scibili et quibusdam aliis. he goes wrong by reasonof his very profundity, and of his error we have a natural type in thecontemplation of a star. he who regards it directly and intensely sees,it is true, the star, but it is the star without a raywhile he whosurveys it less inquisitively is conscious of all for which the star isuseful to us belowits brilliancy and its beauty.\"as to wordsworth, i have no faith in him. that he had in youth thefeelings of a poet i believefor there are glimpses of extreme delicacyin his writings(and delicacy is the poets own kingdomhis eldorado)but they have the appearance of a better day recollected; andglimpses, at best, are little evidence of present poetic fire; we knowthat a few straggling flowers spring up daily in the crevices of theglacier.\"he was to blame in wearing away his youth in contemplation with the endof poetizing in his manhood. with the increase of his judgment the lightwhich should make it apparent has faded away. his judgment consequentlyis too correct. this may not be understood,but the old goths ofgermany would have understood it, who used to debate matters ofimportance to their state twice, once when drunk, and once whensobersober that they might not be deficient in formalitydrunk lestthey should be destitute of vigor.\"the long wordy discussions by which he tries to reason us intoadmiration of his poetry, speak very little in his favor they are fullof such assertions as this (i have opened one of his volumes atrandom)of genius the only proof is the act of doing well what isworthy to be done, and what was never done before;indeed? then itfollows that in doing what is unworthy to be done, or what has beendone before, no genius can be evinced; yet the picking of pockets is anunworthy act, pockets have been picked time immemorial, and barrington,the pickpocket, in point of genius, would have thought hard of acomparison with william wordsworth, the poet.\"again, in estimating the merit of certain poems, whether they beossians or macphersons can surely be of little consequence, yet, inorder to prove their worthlessness, mr. w. has expended many pages inthe controversy. tantne animis? can great minds descend to suchabsurdity? but worse still that he may bear down every argument infavor of these poems, he triumphantly drags forward a passage, in hisabomination with which he expects the reader to sympathise. it is thebeginning of the epic poem temora. the blue waves of ullin roll inlight; the green hills are covered with day; trees shake their dustyheads in the breeze. and thisthis gorgeous, yet simple imagery, whereall is alive and panting with immortalitythis, william wordsworth, theauthor of peter bell, has

example taught  why did i leave it, and, adrift,  trust to the fire within, for light?  we grew in ageand lovetogether  roaming the forest, and the wild;  my breast her shield in wintry weather  and, when the friendly sunshine smiled.  and she would mark the opening skies,  i saw no heavenbut in her eyes.  young loves first lesson isthe heart  for mid that sunshine, and those smiles,  when, from our little cares apart,  and laughing at her girlish wiles,  id throw me on her throbbing breast,  and pour my spirit out in tears  there was no need to speak the rest  no need to quiet any fears  of herwho asked no reason why,  but turned on me her quiet eye!  yet more than worthy of the love  my spirit struggled with, and strove  when, on the mountain peak, alone,  ambition lent it a new tone  i had no beingbut in thee  the world, and all it did contain  in the earththe airthe sea  its joyits little lot of pain  that was new pleasurethe ideal,  dim, vanities of dreams by night  and dimmer nothings which were real  (shadowsand a more shadowy light!)  parted upon their misty wings,  and, so, confusedly, became  thine image anda namea name!  two separateyet most intimate things.  i was ambitioushave you known  the passion, father? you have not  a cottager, i marked a throne  of half the world as all my own,  and murmured at such lowly lot  but, just like any other dream,  upon the vapor of the dew  my own had past, did not the beam  of beauty which did while it thro  the minutethe hourthe dayoppress  my mind with double loveliness.  we walked together on the crown  of a high mountain which looked down  afar from its proud natural towers  of rock and forest, on the hills  the dwindled hills! begirt with bowers  and shouting with a thousand rills.  i spoke to her of power and pride,  but mysticallyin such guise  that she might deem it nought beside  the moments converse; in her eyes  i read, perhaps too carelessly  a mingled feeling with my own  the flush on her bright cheek, to me  seemed to become a queenly throne  too well that i should let it be  light in the wilderness alone.  i wrapped myself in grandeur then,  and donned a visionary crown  yet it was not that fantasy  had thrown her mantle over me  but that, among the rabblemen,  lion ambition is chained down  and crouches to a keepers hand  not so in deserts where the grand  the wildthe terrible conspire  with their own breath to fan his fire.  look round thee now on samarcand!  is she not queen of earth? her pride  above all cities? in her hand  their destinies? in all beside  of glory which the world hath known  stands she not nobly and alone?  fallingher veriest steppingstone  shall form the pedestal of a throne  and who her sovereign? timourhe  whom the astonished people saw  striding oer empires haughtily  a diademed outlaw!  o, human love! thou spirit given,  on earth, of all we hope in heaven!  which fallst into the soul like rain  upon the sirocwithered plain,  and, failing in thy power to bless,  but leavst the heart a wilderness!  idea! which bindest life around  with music of so strange a sound  and beauty of so wild a birth  farewell! for i have won the earth.  when hope, the eagle that towered, could see  no cliff beyond him in the sky,  his pinions were bent droopingly  and homeward turned his softened eye.  twas sunset when the sun will part  there comes a sullenness of heart  to him who still would look upon  the glory of the summer sun.  that soul will hate the evning mist  so often lovely, and will list  to the sound of the coming darkness (known  to those whose spirits hearken) as one  who, in a dream of night, would fly,  but cannot, from a danger nigh.  what tho the moontho the white moon  shed all the splendor of her noon,  her smile is chillyand her beam,  in that time of dreariness, will seem  (so like you gather in your breath)  a portrait taken after death.  and boyhood is a summer sun  whose waning is the dreariest one  for all we live to know is known,  and all we seek to keep hath flown  let life, then, as the dayflower, fall  with the noonday beautywhich is all.  i reached my homemy home no more  for all had flown who made it so.  i passed from out its mossy door,  and, tho my tread was soft and low,  a voice came from the threshold stone  of one whom i had earlier known  o, i defy thee, hell, to show  on beds of fire that burn below,  an humbler hearta deeper woe.  father, i firmly do believe  i knowfor death who comes for me  from regions of the blest afar,  where there is nothing to deceive,  hath left his iron gate ajar.  and rays of truth you cannot see  are flashing thro eternity  i do believe that eblis hath  a snare in every human path  else how, when in the holy grove  i wandered of the idol, love,  who daily scents his snowy wings  with incense of burntofferings  from the most unpolluted things,  whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven  above with trellised rays from heaven  no mote may shunno tiniest fly  the lightning of his eagle eye  how was it that ambition crept,  unseen, amid the revels there,  till growing bold, he laughed and leapt  in the tangles of loves very hair!.

window niche,    how statuelike i see thee stand,    the agate lamp within thy hand!  ah, psyche, from the regions which    are holy land!.                                   the valley of unrest.  once it smiled a silent dell  where the people did not dwell;  they had gone unto the wars,  trusting to the mildeyed stars,  nightly, from their azure towers,  to keep watch above the flowers,  in the midst of which all day  the red sunlight lazily lay,  now each visitor shall confess  the sad valleys restlessness.  nothing there is motionless  nothing save the airs that brood  over the magic solitude.  ah, by no wind are stirred those trees  that palpitate like the chill seas  around the misty hebrides!  ah, by no wind those clouds are driven  that rustle through the unquiet heaven  unceasingly, from morn till even,  over the violets there that lie  in myriad types of the human eye  over the lilies that wave  and weep above a nameless grave!  they wavefrom out their fragrant tops

heartstrings are a lute;\"  none sing so wildly well  as the angel israfel,  and the giddy stars (so legends tell),  ceasing their hymns, attend the spell    of his voice, all mute.  tottering above    in her highest noon,    the enamoured moon  blushes with love,    while, to listen, the red levin    (with the rapid pleiads, even,    which were seven),    pauses in heaven.  and they say (the starry choir    and the other listening things)  that israfelis fire  is owing to that lyre    by which he sits and sings  the trembling living wire  of those unusual strings.  but the skies that angel trod,    where deep thoughts are a duty  where loves a growup god    where the houri glances are  imbued with all the beauty    which we worship in a star.  therefore, thou art not wrong,    israfeli, who despisest  an unimpassioned song;  to thee the laurels belong,    best bard, because the wisest!  merrily live and long!  the ecstasies above    with thy burning measures suit  thy grief, thy joy, thy hate, thy love,    with the fervor of thy lute    well may the stars be mute!  yes, heaven is thine; but this    is a world of sweets and sours;    our flowers are merelyflowers,  and the shadow of thy perfect bliss    is the sunshine of ours.  if i could dwell  where israfel    hath dwelt, and he where i,  he might not sing so wildly well    a mortal melody,  while a bolder

which i could not love the less  so lovely was the loneliness  of a wild lake, with black rock bound,  and the tall pines that towered around.  but when the night had thrown her pall  upon the spot, as upon all,  and the mystic wind went by  murmuring in melody  thenah, then, i would awake  to the terror of the lone lake.  yet that terror was not fright,  but a tremulous delight  a feeling not the jewelled mine  could teach or bribe me to define  nor lovealthough the love were thine.  death was in that poisonous wave,  and in its gulf a fitting grave  for him who thence could solace bring

early found anacreon rhymes  were almost passionate sometimes  and by strange alchemy of brain  his pleasures always turned to pain  his navet to wild desire  his wit to lovehis wine to fire  and so, being young and dipt in folly,  i fell in love with melancholy.  and used to throw my earthly rest  and quiet all away in jest  i could not love except where death  was mingling his with beautys breath  or hymen, time, and destiny,  were stalking between her and me.                                     but now my soul hath too much room  gone are the glory and the gloom  the black hath mellowd into gray,  and all the fires are fading away.  my draught of passion hath been deep  i revelld, and i now would sleep  and after drunkenness of soul  succeeds the glories of the bowl  an idle longing night and day  to dream my very life away.  but dreamsof those who dream as i,  aspiringly, are damned, and die  yet should i swear i mean alone,  by notes so very shrilly blown,  to break upon times monotone,  while yet my vapid joy and grief  are tintless of the yellow leaf  why not an imp the greybeard hath,  will shake his shadow in my path  and een the greybeard will oerlook  connivingly my dreamingbook.                                                                    doubtful poems.                                   alone.  from childhoods hour i have not been  as others werei have

mountain  from the sun that round me rolld  in its autumn tint of gold  from the lightning in the sky  as it passed me flying by  from the thunder and the storm  and the cloud that took the form  (when the rest of heaven was blue)  of a demon in my view.march , .                                   to isadore.i.       beneath the vineclad eaves,             whose shadows fall before             thy lowly cottage door         under the lilacs tremulous leaves         within thy snowy clasped hand             the purple flowers it bore.         last eve in dreams, i saw thee stand,         like queenly nymph from fairyland         enchantress of the flowery wand,             most beauteous isadore!ii.      and when i bade the dream             upon thy spirit flee,             thy violet eyes to me         upturned, did overflowing seem         with the deep, untold delight             of loves serenity;         thy classic brow, like lilies white         and pale as the imperial night         upon her throne, with stars bedight,             enthralled my soul to thee!iii.     ah! ever i behold             thy dreamy, passionate eyes,             blue as the languid skies         hung with the sunsets fringe of gold;         now strangely clear thine image grows,             and olden memories         are startled from their long repose         like shadows on the silent snows         when suddenly the nightwind blows             where quiet moonlight lies.iv.      like music heard in dreams,             like strains of harps unknown,             of birds for ever flown,         audible as the voice of streams         that murmur in some leafy dell,             i hear thy gentlest tone,         and silence cometh with her spell         like that which on my tongue doth dwell,         when tremulous in dreams i tell             my love to thee alone!v.       in every valley heard,             floating from tree to tree,             less beautiful to me,         the music of the radiant bird,         than artless accents such as thine             whose echoes never flee!         ah! how for thy sweet voice i pine         for uttered in thy tones benign         (enchantress!) this rude name of mine             doth seem a melody!                                   the village street.  in these rapid, restless shadows,    once i walked at eventide,  when a gentle, silent maiden,    walked in beauty at my side.  she alone there walked beside me  all in beauty, like a bride.  pallidly the moon was shining    on the dewy meadows nigh;  on the silvery, silent rivers,    on the mountains far and high,  on the oceans starlit waters,    where the winds aweary die.  slowly, silently we wandered    from the open cottage door,  underneath the elms long branches    to the pavement bending oer;  underneath the mossy willow    and the dying sycamore.  with the myriad stars in beauty    all bedight, the heavens were seen,  radiant hopes were bright around me,    like the light of stars serene;  like the mellow midnight splendor    of the nights irradiate queen.  audibly the elmleaves whispered    peaceful, pleasant melodies,  like the distant murmured music    of unquiet, lovely seas;  while the winds were hushed in slumber    in the fragrant flowers and trees.  wondrous and unwonted beauty    still adorning all did seem,  while i told my love in fables    neath the willows by the stream;  would the heart have kept unspoken    love that was its rarest dream!  instantly away we wandered    in the shadowy twilight tide,  she, the silent, scornful maiden,    walking calmly at my side,  with a step serene and stately,    all in beauty, all in pride.  vacantly i walked beside her.    on the earth mine eyes were cast;  swift and keen there came unto me    bitter memories of the past  on me, like the rain in autumn    on the dead leaves, cold and fast.  underneath the elms we parted,    by the lowly cottage door;  one brief word alone was uttered    never on our lips before;  and away i walked forlornly,  brokenhearted evermore.  slowly, silently i loitered,    homeward, in the night, alone;  sudden anguish bound my spirit,    that my youth had never known;  wild unrest, like that which cometh    when the nights first dream hath flown.  now, to me the elmleaves whisper    mad, discordant melodies,  and keen melodies like shadows    haunt the moaning willow trees,  and the sycamores with laughter    mock me in the nightly breeze.  sad and pale the autumn moonlight    through the sighing foliage streams;  and each morning, midnight shadow,    shadow of my sorrow seems;  strive, o heart, forget thine idol!    and, o soul, forget thy dreams!                                   the forest reverie.      tis said that when      the hands of men    tamed this primeval wood,  and hoary trees with groans of wo,  like warriors by an unknown foe,    were in their strength subdued,      the virgin earth      gave instant birth    to springs that neer did flow      that in the sun      did rivulets run,  and all around rare flowers did blow      the wild rose pale      perfumed the gale,  and the queenly lily adown the dale      (whom the sun and the dew      and the winds did woo),  with the gourd and the grape luxuriant grew.      so when in tears      the love of years    is wasted like the snow,  and the fine fibrils of its life  by the rude wrong of instant strife    are broken at a blow      within the heart      do springs upstart    of which it doth now know,      and strange, sweet dreams,      like silent streams  that from new fountains overflow,      with the earlier tide      of rivers glide  deep in the heart whose hope has died  quenching the fires its ashes hide,    its ashes, whence will spring and grow      sweet flowers, ere long,    the rare and radiant flowers of song!                                   notes.of the many verses from time to time ascribed to the pen of edgar poe,and not included among his known writings, the lines entitled \"alone\"have the chief claim to our notice. facsimile copies of this piecehad been in possession of the present editor some time previous to itspublication in scribners magazine for september ; but as proofsof the authorship claimed for it were not forthcoming, he refrained frompublishing it as requested. the desired proofs have not yet beenadduced, and there is, at present, nothing but internal evidence toguide us. \"alone\" is stated to have been written by poe in the album ofa baltimore lady (mrs. balderstone?), on march th, , and thefacsimile given in scribners is alleged to be of his handwriting.if the caligraphy be poes, it is different in all essential respectsfrom all the many specimens known to us, and strongly resembles that ofthe writer of the heading and dating of the manuscript, both of whichthe contributor of the poem acknowledges to have been recently added.the lines, however, if not by poe, are the most successful imitation ofhis early mannerisms yet made public, and, in the opinion of one wellqualified to speak, \"are not unworthy on the whole of the parentageclaimed for them.\"whilst edgar poe was editor of the broadway journal, some lines \"toisadore\" appeared therein, and, like several of his known pieces, boreno signature. they were at once ascribed to poe, and in order to satisfyquestioners, an editorial paragraph subsequently appeared, saying theywere by \"a. ide, junior.\" two previous poems had appeared in thebroadway journal over the signature of \"a. m. ide,\" and whoever wrotethem was also the author of the lines \"to isadore.\" in order, doubtless,to give a show of variety, poe was then publishing some of his knownworks in his journal over noms de plume, and as no other writingswhatever can be traced to any person bearing the name of \"a. m. ide,\" itis not impossible that the poems now republished in this collection maybe by the author of \"the raven.\" having been published without his usualelaborate revision, poe may have wished to hide his hasty work under anassumed name. the three pieces are included in the present collection,so the reader can judge for himself what pretensions they possess to beby the author of \"the raven.\"                                                                 prose poems.

calling \"moral tales,\" as if inmockery of their spirit\"la musique est le seul des talens qui jouissede luimeme tous les autres veulent des temoins.\" he here confoundsthe pleasure derivable from sweet sounds with the capacity for creatingthem. no more than any other talent, is that for music susceptible ofcomplete enjoyment where there is no second party to appreciate itsexercise; and it is only in common with other talents that it produceseffects which may be fully enjoyed in solitude. the idea which theraconteur has either failed to entertain clearly, or has sacrificed inits expression to his national love of point, is doubtless the verytenable one that the higher order of music is the most thoroughlyestimated when we are exclusively alone. the proposition in this formwill be admitted at once by those who love the lyre for its own sake andfor its spiritual uses. but there is one pleasure still within the reachof fallen mortality, and perhaps only one, which owes even more thandoes music to the accessory sentiment of seclusion. i mean the happinessexperienced in the contemplation of natural scenery. in truth, the manwho would behold aright the glory of god upon earth must in solitudebehold that glory. to me at least the presence, not of human life only,but of life, in any other form than that of the green things which growupon the soil and are voiceless, is a stain upon the landscape, is atwar with the genius of the scene. i love, indeed, to regard the darkvalleys, and the gray rocks, and the waters that silently smile, and theforests that sigh in uneasy slumbers, and the proud watchful mountainsthat look down upon all,i love to regard these as themselves but thecolossal members of one vast animate and sentient wholea whole whoseform (that of the sphere) is the most perfect and most inclusive of all;whose path is among associate planets; whose meek handmaiden is themoon; whose mediate sovereign is the sun; whose life is eternity; whosethought is that of a god; whose enjoyment is knowledge; whose destiniesare lost in immensity; whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with ourown cognizance of the animalcul which infest the brain, a being whichwe in consequence regard as purely inanimate and material, much in thesame manner as these animalcul must thus regard us.our telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us on everyhand, notwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of the priesthood,that space, and therefore that bulk, is an important consideration inthe eyes of the almighty. the cycles in which the stars move are thosebest adapted for the evolution, without collision, of the greatestpossible number of bodies. the forms of those bodies are accurately suchas within a given surface to include the greatest possible amount ofmatter; while the surfaces themselves are so disposed as to accommodatea denser population than could be accommodated on the same surfacesotherwise arranged. nor is it any argument against bulk being an objectwith god that space itself is infinite; for there may be an infinity ofmatter to fill it; and since we see clearly that the endowment of matterwith vitality is a principleindeed, as far as our judgments extend,the leading principle in the operations of deity, it is scarcelylogical to imagine it confined to the regions of the minute, where wedaily trace it, and not extending to those of the august. as we findcycle within cycle without end, yet all revolving around one fardistantcentre which is the godhead, may we not analogically suppose, in thesame manner, life within life, the less within the greater, and allwithin the spirit divine? in short, we are madly erring throughselfesteem in believing man, in either his temporal or futuredestinies, to be of more moment in the universe than that vast \"clod ofthe valley\" which he tills and contemns, and to which he denies a soul,for no more profound reason than that he does not behold it in operation.these fancies, and such as these, have always given to my meditationsamong the mountains and the forests, by the rivers and the ocean, atinge of what the everyday world would not fail to term the fantastic.my wanderings amid such scenes have been many and farsearching, andoften solitary; and the interest with which i have strayed through manya dim deep valley, or gazed into the reflected heaven of many a brightlake, has been an interest greatly deepened by the thought that i havestrayed and gazed alone. what flippant frenchman  was it who said,in allusion to the well known work of zimmermann, that \"la solitude estune belle chose; mais il faut quelquun pour vous dire que la solitudeest une belle chose\"? the epigram cannot be gainsaid; but the necessityis a thing that does not exist.it was during one of my lonely journeyings, amid a far distant region ofmountain locked within mountain, and sad rivers and melancholy tarnswrithing or sleeping within all, that i chanced upon a certain rivuletand island. i came upon them suddenly in the leafy june, and threwmyself upon the turf beneath the branches of an unknown odorous shrub,that i might doze as i contemplated the scene. i felt that thus onlyshould i look upon it, such was the character of phantasm which it wore.on all sides, save to the west where the sun was about sinking, arosethe verdant walls of the forest. the little river which turned sharplyin its course, and was thus immediately lost to sight, seemed to have noexit from its prison, but to be absorbed by the deep green foliage ofthe trees to the east; while in the opposite quarter (so it appeared tome as i lay at length and glanced upward) there poured down noiselesslyand continuously into the valley a rich golden and crimson waterfallfrom the sunset fountains of the sky.about midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision took in, onesmall circular island, profusely verdured, reposed upon the bosom of thestream.  so blended bank and shadow there,  that each seemed pendulous in airso mirrorlike was the glassy water, that it was scarcely possible tosay at what point upon the slope of the emerald turf its crystaldominion began. my position enabled me to include in a single view boththe eastern and western extremities of the islet, and i observed asingularlymarked difference in their aspects. the latter was all oneradiant harem of garden beauties. it glowed and blushed beneath the eyeof the slant sunlight, and fairly laughed with flowers. the grass wasshort, springy, sweetscented, and asphodelinterspersed. the trees werelithe, mirthful, erect, bright, slender, and graceful, of eastern figureand foliage, with bark smooth, glossy, and particolored. there seemed adeep sense of life and joy about all, and although no airs blew from outthe heavens, yet everything had motion through the gentle sweepings toand fro of innumerable butterflies, that might have been mistaken fortulips with wings .the other or eastern end of the isle was whelmed in the blackest shade.a sombre, yet beautiful and peaceful gloom, here pervaded all things.the trees were dark in color and mournful in form and attitudewreathing themselves into sad, solemn, and spectral shapes, thatconveyed ideas of mortal sorrow and untimely death. the grass wore thedeep tint of the cypress, and the heads of its blades hung droopingly,and hither and thither among it were many small unsightly hillocks, lowand narrow, and not very long, that had the aspect of graves, but werenot, although over and all about them the rue and the rosemaryclambered. the shades of the trees fell heavily upon the water, andseemed to bury itself therein, impregnating the depths of the elementwith darkness. i fancied that each shadow, as the sun descended lowerand lower, separated itself sullenly from the trunk that gave it birth,and thus became absorbed by the stream, while other shadows issuedmomently from the trees, taking the place of their predecessors thusentombed.this idea having once seized upon my fancy greatly excited it, and ilost myself forthwith in reverie. \"if ever island were enchanted,\" saidi to myself, \"this is it. this is the haunt of the few gentle fays whoremain from the wreck of the race. are these green tombs theirs?or dothey yield up their sweet lives as mankind yield up their own? in dying,do they not rather waste away mournfully, rendering unto god little bylittle their existence, as these trees render up shadow after shadow,exhausting their substance unto dissolution? what the wasting tree is tothe water that imbibes its shade, growing thus blacker by what it preysupon, may not the life of the fay be to the death which engulfs it?\"as i thus mused, with halfshut eyes, while the sun sank rapidly torest, and eddying currents careered round and round the island, bearingupon their bosom large dazzling white flakes of the bark of thesycamore, flakes which, in their multiform positions upon the water, aquick imagination might have converted into anything it pleased; while ithus mused, it appeared to me that the form of one of those very faysabout whom i had been pondering, made its way slowly into the darknessfrom out the light at the western end of the island. she stood erect ina singularly fragile canoe, and urged it with the mere phantom of anoar. while within the influence of the lingering sunbeams, her attitudeseemed indicative of joy, but sorrow deformed it as she passed withinthe shade. slowly she glided along, and at length rounded the islet andreentered the region of light. \"the revolution which has just been madeby the fay,\" continued i musingly, \"is the cycle of the brief year ofher life. she has floated through her winter and through her summer. sheis a year nearer unto death for i did not fail to see that as she cameinto the shade, her shadow fell from her, and was swallowed up in thedark water, making its blackness more black.\"and again the boat appeared and the fay, but about the attitude of thelatter there was more of care and uncertainty and less of elastic joy.she floated again from out the light and into the gloom (which deepenedmomently), and again her shadow fell from her into the ebony water, andbecame absorbed into its blackness. and again and again she made thecircuit of the island (while the sun rushed down to his slumbers), andat each issuing into the light there was more sorrow about her person,while it grew feebler and far fainter and more indistinct, and at eachpassage into the gloom there fell from her a darker shade, which becamewhelmed in a shadow more black. but at length, when the sun had utterlydeparted, the fay, now the mere ghost of her former self, wentdisconsolately with her boat into the region of the ebony flood, andthat she issued thence at all i cannot say, for darkness fell over allthings, and i beheld her magical figure no more.footnote  moraux is here derived from moeurs, and

agathos, the weakness of a spirit newfledged with  immortality!agathos.  you have spoken nothing, my oinos, for which pardon is to be demanded.  not even here is knowledge a thing of intuition. for wisdom, ask of  the angels freely, that it may be given!oinos.  but in this existence i dreamed that i should be at once cognizant of  all things, and thus at once happy in being cognizant of all.agathos.  ah, not in knowledge is happiness, but in the acquisition of  knowledge! in forever knowing, we are forever blessed; but to know  all, were the curse of a fiend.oinos.  but does not the most high know all?agathos.  that (since he is the most happy) must be still the one thing  unknown even to him.oinos.  but, since we grow hourly in knowledge, must not at last all things  be known?agathos.  look down into the abysmal distances!attempt to force the gaze down  the multitudinous vistas of the stars, as we sweep slowly through them  thusand thusand thus! even the spiritual vision, is it not at all  points arrested by the continuous golden walls of the universe?the  walls of the myriads of the shining bodies that mere number has  appeared to blend into unity?oinos.  i clearly perceive that the infinity of matter is no dream.agathos.  there are no dreams in aidennbut it is here whispered that, of this  infinity of matter, the sole purpose is to afford infinite springs  at which the soul may allay the thirst to know which is forever  unquenchable within itsince to quench it would be to extinguish the  souls self. question me then, my oinos, freely and without fear.  come! we will leave to the left the loud harmony of the pleiades, and  swoop outward from the throne into the starry meadows beyond orion,  where, for pansies and violets, and heartsease, are the beds of the  triplicate and tripletinted suns.oinos.  and now, agathos, as we proceed, instruct me!speak to me in the  earths familiar tones! i understand not what you hinted to me just  now of the modes or of the methods of what during mortality, we were  accustomed to call creation. do you mean to say that the creator is  not god?agathos.  i mean to say that the deity does not create.oinos.  explain!agathos.  in the beginning only, he created. the seeming creatures which are now  throughout the universe so perpetually springing into being can only  be considered as the mediate or indirect, not as the direct or  immediate results of the divine creative power.oinos.  among men, my agathos, this idea would be considered heretical in the  extreme.agathos.  among the angels, my oinos, it is seen to be simply true.oinos.  i can comprehend you thus farthat certain operations of what we term  nature, or the natural laws, will, under certain conditions, give rise  to that which has all the appearance of creation. shortly before the  final overthrow of the earth, there were, i well remember, many very  successful experiments in what some philosophers were weak enough to  denominate the creation of animalcul.agathos.  the cases of which you speak were, in fact, instances of the secondary  creation, and of the only species of creation which has ever been  since the first word spoke into existence the first law.oinos.  are not the starry worlds that, from the abyss of nonentity, burst  hourly forth into the heavensare not these stars, agathos, the  immediate handiwork of the king?agathos.  let me endeavor, my oinos, to lead you, step by step, to the  conception i intend. you are well aware that, as no thought can  perish, so no act is without infinite result. we moved our hands, for  example, when we were dwellers on the earth, and in so doing we gave  vibration to the atmosphere which engirdled it. this vibration was  indefinitely extended till it gave impulse to every particle of the  earths air, which thenceforward, and forever, was actuated by the  one movement of the hand. this fact the mathematicians of our globe  well knew. they made the special effects, indeed, wrought in the fluid  by special impulses, the subject of exact calculationso that it  became easy to determine in what precise period an impulse of given  extent would engirdle the orb, and impress (forever) every atom of the  atmosphere circumambient. retrograding, they found no difficulty; from  a given effect, under given conditions, in determining the value of  the original impulse. now the mathematicians who saw that the results  of any given impulse were absolutely endlessand who saw that a  portion of these results were accurately traceable through the agency  of algebraic analysiswho saw, too, the facility of the  retrogradationthese men saw, at the same time, that this species of  analysis itself had within itself a capacity for indefinite  progressthat there were no bounds conceivable to its advancement and  applicability, except within the intellect of him who advanced or  applied it. but at this point our mathematicians paused.oinos.  and why, agathos, should they have proceeded?agathos.  because there were some considerations of deep interest beyond. it was  deducible from what they knew, that to a being of infinite  understandingone to whom the perfection of the algebraic analysis  lay unfoldedthere could be no difficulty in tracing every impulse  given the airand the ether through the airto the remotest  consequences at any even infinitely remote epoch of time. it is indeed  demonstrable that every such impulse given the air, must in the  end impress every individual thing that exists within the  universe;and the being of infinite understandingthe being whom  we have imaginedmight trace the remote undulations of the  impulsetrace them upward and onward in their influences upon all  particles of all matterupward and onward forever in their  modifications of old formsor, in other words, in their creation of  newuntil he found them reflectedunimpressive at lastback from  the throne of the godhead. and not only could such a being do this,  but at any epoch, should a given result be afforded himshould one of  these numberless comets, for example, be presented to his  inspectionhe could have no difficulty in determining, by the  analytic retrogradation, to what original impulse it was due. this  power of retrogradation in its absolute fulness and perfectionthis  faculty of referring at all epochs, all effects to all  causesis of course the prerogative of the deity alonebut in every  variety of degree, short of the absolute perfection, is the power  itself exercised by the whole host of the angelic intelligences.oinos.  but you speak merely of impulses upon the air.agathos.  in speaking of the air, i referred only to the earth but the general  proposition has reference to impulses upon the etherwhich, since it  pervades, and alone pervades all space, is thus the great medium of  creation.oinos.  then all motion, of whatever nature, creates?agathos.  it must but a true philosophy has long taught that the source of all  motion is thoughtand the source of all thought isoinos.  god.agathos.  i have spoken to you, oinos, as to a child, of the fair earth which  lately perishedof impulses upon the atmosphere of the earth.oinos.  you did.agathos.  and while i thus spoke, did there not cross your mind some thought of  the physical power of words? is not every word an impulse on the  air?oinos.  but why, agathos, do you weepand why, oh, why do your wings droop as  we hover above this fair starwhich is the greenest and yet most  terrible of all we have encountered in our flight? its brilliant  flowers look like a fairy dreambut its fierce volcanoes like the  passions of a turbulent heart.agathos.  they are!they are!this wild starit is now three centuries  since, with clasped hands, and with streaming eyes, at the feet of my  belovedi spoke itwith a few passionate sentencesinto birth. its  brilliant flowers are the dearest of all unfulfilled dreams, and its  raging volcanoes are the passions of the most turbulent and  unhallowed of hearts!                                     \"by the murmur of a spring,  or the least boughs rustleling,  by a daisy whose leaves spread,  shut when titan goes to bed,  or a shady bush or tree,  she could more infuse in me  than all natures beauties con  in some other wiser man.  by her help i also now  make this churlish place allow  something that may sweeten gladness  in the very gall of sadness  the dull loneness, the black shade,  that these hanging vaults have made  the strange music of the waves  beating on these hollow caves,  this black den which rocks emboss,  overgrown with eldest moss,  the rude portals that give light  more to terror than delight,  this my chamber of neglect  walled about with disrespect;  from all these and this dull air  a fit object for despair,  she hath taught me by her might  to draw comfort and delight.\"  \"it is a wondrous thing how fleet  twas on those little silver feet,  with what a pretty skipping grace  it oft would challenge me the race,  and whent had left me far away  twould stay, and run again, and stay;  for it was nimbler much than hinds,

only loved to be there.  among the beds of lilies i  have sought it oft where it should lie,  yet could not, till itself would rise,  find it, although before mine eyes.  for in the flaxen lilies shade  it like a bank of lilies laid;  upon the roses it would feed  until its lips even seemed to bleed,  and then to me twould boldly trip,  and print those roses on my lip,  but all its chief delight was still  with roses thus itself to fill,  and its pure virgin limbs to fold  in whitest sheets of lilies cold,  had it lived long, it would have been  lilies without, roses within.\"  \"and trod as if on the four winds!\"  \"and its pure virgin limbs to fold  in whitest sheets of lilies cold,\"  \"had it lived long, it would have been  lilies without, roses within.\"i from fairest creatures we desire increase, that thereby beautys rose might never die, but as the riper should by time decease, his tender heir might bear his memory but thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes, feedst thy lights flame with selfsubstantial fuel, making a famine where abundance lies, thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel thou that art now the worlds fresh ornament, and only herald to the gaudy spring, within thine own bud buriest thy content, and tender churl makst waste in niggarding   pity the world, or else this glutton be,   to eat the worlds due, by the grave and thee. ii when forty winters shall besiege thy brow, and dig deep trenches in thy beautys field, thy youths proud livery so gazed on now, will be a tatterd weed of small worth held then being asked, where all thy beauty lies, where all the treasure of thy lusty days; to say, within thine own deep sunken eyes, were an alleating shame, and thriftless praise. how much more praise deservd thy beautys use, if thou couldst answer this fair child of mine shall sum my count, and make my old excuse, proving his beauty by succession thine!   this were to be new made when thou art old,   and see thy blood warm when thou feelst it cold. iii look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest now is the time that face should form another; whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest, thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother. for where is she so fair whose uneard womb disdains the tillage of thy husbandry? or who is he so fond will be the tomb, of his selflove to stop posterity? thou art thy mothers glass and she in thee calls back the lovely april of her prime; so thou through windows of thine age shalt see, despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.   but if thou live, rememberd not to be,   die single and thine image dies with thee. iv unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend upon thy self thy beautys legacy? natures bequest gives nothing, but doth lend, and being frank she lends to those are free then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse the bounteous largess given thee to give? profitless usurer, why dost thou use so great a sum of sums, yet canst not live? for having traffic with thy self alone, thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive then how when nature calls thee to be gone, what acceptable audit canst thou leave?   thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,   which, used, lives th executor to be. v those hours, that with gentle work did frame the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell, will play the tyrants to the very same and that unfair which fairly doth excel; for neverresting time leads summer on to hideous winter, and confounds him there; sap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone, beauty oersnowed and bareness every where then were not summers distillation left, a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass, beautys effect with beauty were bereft, nor it, nor no remembrance what it was   but flowers distilld, though they with winter meet,   leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet. vi then let not winters ragged hand deface, in thee thy summer, ere thou be distilld make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place with beautys treasure ere it be selfkilld. that use is not forbidden usury, which happies those that pay the willing loan; thats for thy self to breed another thee, or ten times happier, be it ten for one; ten times thy self were happier than thou art, if ten of thine ten times refigurd thee then what could death do if thou shouldst depart, leaving thee living in posterity?   be not selfwilld, for thou art much too fair   to be deaths conquest and make worms thine heir. vii lo! in the orient when the gracious light lifts up his burning head, each under eye doth homage to his newappearing sight, serving with looks his sacred majesty; and having climbd the steepup heavenly hill, resembling strong youth in his middle age, yet mortal looks adore his beauty still, attending on his golden pilgrimage but when from highmost pitch, with weary car, like feeble age, he reeleth from the day, the eyes, fore duteous, now converted are from his low tract, and look another way   so thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon   unlookd, on diest unless thou get a son. viii music to hear, why hearst thou music sadly? sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy why lovst thou that which thou receivst not gladly, or else receivst with pleasure thine annoy? if the true concord of welltuned sounds, by unions married, do offend thine ear, they do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear. mark how one string, sweet husband to another, strikes each in each by mutual ordering; resembling sire and child and happy mother, who, all in one, one pleasing note do sing   whose speechless song being many, seeming one,   sings this to thee thou single wilt prove none. ix is it for fear to wet a widows eye, that thou consumst thy self in single life? ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die, the world will wail thee like a makeless wife; the world will be thy widow and still weep that thou no form of thee hast left behind, when every private widow well may keep by childrens eyes, her husbands shape in mind look! what an unthrift in the world doth spend shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it; but beautys waste hath in the world an end, and kept unused the user so destroys it.   no love toward others in that bosom sits   that on himself such murdrous shame commits. x for shame! deny that thou bearst love to any, who for thy self art so unprovident. grant, if thou wilt, thou art belovd of many, but that thou none lovst is most evident for thou art so possessd with murderous hate, that gainst thy self thou stickst not to conspire, seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate which to repair should be thy chief desire. o! change thy thought, that i may change my mind shall hate be fairer lodgd than gentle love? be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind, or to thyself at least kindhearted prove   make thee another self for love of me,   that beauty still may live in thine or thee. xi as fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou growst, in one of thine, from that which thou departest; and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowst, thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest, herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase; without this folly, age, and cold decay if all were minded so, the times should cease and threescore year would make the world away. let those whom nature hath not made for store, harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish look, whom she best endowd, she gave thee more; which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish   she carvd thee for her seal, and meant thereby,   thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die. xii when i do count the clock that tells the time, and see the brave day sunk in hideous night; when i behold the violet past prime, and sable curls, all silvered oer with white; when lofty trees i see barren of leaves, which erst from heat did canopy the herd, and summers green all girded up in sheaves, borne on the bier with white and bristly beard, then of thy beauty do i question make, that thou among the wastes of time must go, since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake and die as fast as they see others grow;   and nothing gainst times scythe can make defence   save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence. xiii o! that you were your self; but, love you are no longer yours, than you your self here live against this coming end you should prepare, and your sweet semblance to some other give so should that beauty which you hold in lease find no determination; then you were yourself again, after yourselfs decease, when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear. who lets so fair a house fall to decay, which husbandry in honour might uphold, against the stormy gusts of winters day and barren rage of deaths eternal cold?   o! none but unthrifts. dear my love, you know,   you had a father let your son say so. xiv not from the stars do i my judgement pluck; and yet methinks i have astronomy, but not to tell of good or evil luck, of plagues, of dearths, or seasons quality; nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell, pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind, or say with princes if it shall go well by oft predict that i in heaven find but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive, and constant stars in them i read such art as truth and beauty shall together thrive, if from thyself, to store thou wouldst convert;   or else of thee this i prognosticate   thy end is truths and beautys doom and date. xv when i consider every thing that grows holds in perfection but a little moment, that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows whereon the stars in secret influence comment; when i perceive that men as plants increase, cheered and checked even by the selfsame sky, vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease, and wear their brave state out of memory; then the conceit of this inconstant stay sets you most rich in youth before my sight, where wasteful time debateth with decay to change your day of youth to sullied night,   and all in war with time for love of you,   as he takes from you, i engraft you new. xvi but wherefore do not you a mightier way make war upon this bloody tyrant, time? and fortify your self in your decay with means more blessed than my barren rhyme? now stand you on the top of happy hours, and many maiden gardens, yet unset, with virtuous wish would bear you living flowers, much liker than your painted counterfeit so should the lines of life that life repair, which this, times pencil, or my pupil pen, neither in inward worth nor outward fair, can make you live your self in eyes of men.   to give away yourself, keeps yourself still,   and you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill. xvii who will believe my verse in time to come, if it were filld with your most high deserts? though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb which hides your life, and shows not half your parts. if i could write the beauty of your eyes, and in fresh numbers number all your graces, the age to come would say this poet lies; such heavenly touches neer touchd earthly faces. so should my papers, yellowd with their age, be scornd, like old men of less truth than tongue, and your true rights be termd a poets rage and stretched metre of an antique song   but were some child of yours alive that time,   you should live twice,in it, and in my rhyme. xviii shall i compare thee to a summers day? thou art more lovely and more temperate rough winds do shake the darling buds of may, and summers lease hath all too short a date sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, and often is his gold complexion dimmd, and every fair from fair sometime declines, by chance, or natures changing course untrimmd but thy eternal summer shall not fade, nor lose possession of that fair thou owst, nor shall death brag thou wanderst in his shade, when in eternal lines to time thou growst,   so long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,   so long lives this, and this gives life to thee. xix devouring time, blunt thou the lions paws, and make the earth devour her own sweet brood; pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tigers jaws, and burn the longlivd phoenix, in her blood; make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets, and do whateer thou wilt, swiftfooted time, to the wide world and all her fading sweets; but i forbid thee one most heinous crime o! carve not with thy hours my loves fair brow, nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen; him in thy course untainted do allow for beautys pattern to succeeding men.   yet, do thy worst old time despite thy wrong,   my love shall in my verse ever live young. xx a womans face with natures own hand painted, hast thou, the master mistress of my passion; a womans gentle heart, but not acquainted with shifting change, as is false womens fashion an eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling, gilding the object whereupon it gazeth; a man in hue all hues in his controlling, which steals mens eyes and womens souls amazeth. and for a woman wert thou first created; till nature, as she wrought thee, fell adoting, and by addition me of thee defeated, by adding one thing to my purpose nothing.   but since she prickd thee out for womens pleasure,   mine be thy love and thy loves use their treasure. xxi so is it not with me as with that muse, stirrd by a painted beauty to his verse, who heaven itself for ornament doth use and every fair with his fair doth rehearse, making a couplement of proud compare. with sun and moon, with earth and seas rich gems, with aprils firstborn flowers, and all things rare, that heavens air in this huge rondure hems. o! let me, true in love, but truly write, and then believe me, my love is as fair as any mothers child, though not so bright as those gold candles fixd in heavens air   let them say more that like of hearsay well;   i will not praise that purpose not to sell. xxii my glass shall not persuade me i am old, so long as youth and thou are of one date; but when in thee times furrows i behold, then look i death my days should expiate. for all that beauty that doth cover thee, is but the seemly raiment of my heart, which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me how can i then be elder than thou art? o! therefore love, be of thyself so wary as i, not for myself, but for thee will; bearing thy heart, which i will keep so chary as tender nurse her babe from faring ill.   presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,   thou gavst me thine not to give back again. xxiii as an unperfect actor on the stage, who with his fear is put beside his part, or some fierce thing replete with too much rage, whose strengths abundance weakens his own heart; so i, for fear of trust, forget to say the perfect ceremony of loves rite, and in mine own loves strength seem to decay, oerchargd with burthen of mine own loves might. o! let my looks be then the eloquence and dumb presagers of my speaking breast, who plead for love, and look for recompense, more than that tongue that more hath more expressd.   o! learn to read what silent love hath writ   to hear with eyes belongs to loves fine wit. xxiv mine eye hath playd the painter and hath stelld, thy beautys form in table of my heart; my body is the frame wherein tis held, and perspective it is best painters art. for through the painter must you see his skill, to find where your true image picturd lies, which in my bosoms shop is hanging still, that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes. now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me are windows to my breast, wherethrough the sun delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;   yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,   they draw but what they see, know not the heart. xxv let those who are in favour with their stars of public honour and proud titles boast, whilst i, whom fortune of such triumph bars unlookd for joy in that i honour most. great princes favourites their fair leaves spread but as the marigold at the suns eye, and in themselves their pride lies buried, for at a frown they in their glory die. the painful warrior famoused for fight, after a thousand victories once foild, is from the book of honour razed quite, and all the rest forgot for which he toild   then happy i, that love and am belovd,   where i may not remove nor be removd. xxvi lord of my love, to whom in vassalage thy merit hath my duty strongly knit, to thee i send this written embassage, to witness duty, not to show my wit duty so great, which wit so poor as mine may make seem bare, in wanting words to show it, but that i hope some good conceit of thine in thy souls thought, all naked, will bestow it till whatsoever star that guides my moving, points on me graciously with fair aspect, and puts apparel on my tatterd loving, to show me worthy of thy sweet respect   then may i dare to boast how i do love thee;   till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me. xxvii weary with toil, i haste me to my bed, the dear respose for limbs with travel tird; but then begins a journey in my head to work my mind, when bodys works expired for then my thoughtsfrom far where i abide intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee, and keep my drooping eyelids open wide, looking on darkness which the blind do see save that my souls imaginary sight presents thy shadow to my sightless view, which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night, makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.   lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,   for thee, and for myself, no quiet find. xxviii how can i then return in happy plight, that am debarred the benefit of rest? when days oppression is not easd by night, but day by night and night by day oppressd, and each, though enemies to eithers reign, do in consent shake hands to torture me, the one by toil, the other to complain how far i toil, still farther off from thee. i tell the day, to please him thou art bright, and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven so flatter i the swartcomplexiond night, when sparkling stars twire not thou gildst the even.   but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,   and night doth nightly make griefs length seem stronger. xxix when in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes i all alone beweep my outcast state, and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries, and look upon myself, and curse my fate, wishing me like to one more rich in hope, featurd like him, like him with friends possessd, desiring this mans art, and that mans scope, with what i most enjoy contented least; yet in these thoughts my self almost despising, haply i think on thee, and then my state, like to the lark at break of day arising from sullen earth, sings hymns at heavens gate;   for thy sweet love rememberd such wealth brings   that then i scorn to change my state with kings. xxx when to the sessions of sweet silent thought i summon up remembrance of things past, i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought, and with old woes new wail my dear times waste then can i drown an eye, unused to flow, for precious friends hid in deaths dateless night, and weep afresh loves long since cancelld woe, and moan the expense of many a vanishd sight then can i grieve at grievances foregone, and heavily from woe to woe tell oer the sad account of forebemoaned moan, which i new pay as if not paid before.   but if the while i think on thee, dear friend,   all losses are restord and sorrows end. xxxi thy bosom is endeared with all hearts, which i by lacking have supposed dead; and there reigns love, and all loves loving parts, and all those friends which i thought buried. how many a holy and obsequious tear hath dear religious love stoln from mine eye, as interest of the dead, which now appear but things removd that hidden in thee lie! thou art the grave where buried love doth live, hung with the trophies of my lovers gone, who all their parts of me to thee did give, that due of many now is thine alone   their images i lovd, i view in thee,   and thouall theyhast all the all of me. xxxii if thou survive my wellcontented day, when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover and shalt by fortune once more resurvey these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover, compare them with the bettring of the time, and though they be outstrippd by every pen, reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme, exceeded by the height of happier men. o! then vouchsafe me but this loving thought had my friends muse grown with this growing age, a dearer birth than this his love had brought, to march in ranks of better equipage   but since he died and poets better prove,   theirs for their style ill read, his for his love. xxxiii full many a glorious morning have i seen flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye, kissing with golden face the meadows green, gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy; anon permit the basest clouds to ride with ugly rack on his celestial face, and from the forlorn world his visage hide, stealing unseen to west with this disgrace even so my sun one early morn did shine, with all triumphant splendour on my brow; but out! alack! he was but one hour mine, the region cloud hath maskd him from me now.   yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;   suns of the world may stain when heavens sun staineth. xxxiv why didst thou promise such a beauteous day, and make me travel forth without my cloak, to let base clouds oertake me in my way, hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke? tis not enough that through the cloud thou break, to dry the rain on my stormbeaten face, for no man well of such a salve can speak, that heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace nor can thy shame give physic to my grief; though thou repent, yet i have still the loss the offenders sorrow lends but weak relief to him that bears the strong offences cross.   ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,   and they are rich and ransom all ill deeds. xxxv no more be grievd at that which thou hast done roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun, and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud. all men make faults, and even i in this, authorizing thy trespass with compare, myself corrupting, salving thy amiss, excusing thy sins more than thy sins are; for to thy sensual fault i bring in sense, thy adverse party is thy advocate, and gainst myself a lawful plea commence such civil war is in my love and hate,   that i an accessary needs must be,   to that sweet thief which sourly robs from me. xxxvi let me confess that we two must be twain, although our undivided loves are one so shall those blots that do with me remain, without thy help, by me be borne alone. in our two loves there is but one respect, though in our lives a separable spite, which though it alter not loves sole effect, yet doth it steal sweet hours from loves delight. i may not evermore acknowledge thee, lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame, nor thou with public kindness honour me, unless thou take that honour from thy name   but do not so, i love thee in such sort,   as thou being mine, mine is thy good report. xxxvii as a decrepit father takes delight to see his active child do deeds of youth, so i, made lame by fortunes dearest spite, take all my comfort of thy worth and truth; for whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit, or any of these all, or all, or more, entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit, i make my love engrafted, to this store so then i am not lame, poor, nor despisd, whilst that this shadow doth such substance give that i in thy abundance am sufficd, and by a part of all thy glory live.   look what is best, that best i wish in thee   this wish i have; then ten times happy me! xxxviii how can my muse want subject to invent, while thou dost breathe, that pourst into my verse thine own sweet argument, too excellent for every vulgar paper to rehearse? o! give thy self the thanks, if aught in me worthy perusal stand against thy sight; for whos so dumb that cannot write to thee, when thou thy self dost give invention light? be thou the tenth muse, ten times more in worth than those old nine which rhymers invocate; and he that calls on thee, let him bring forth eternal numbers to outlive long date.   if my slight muse do please these curious days,   the pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise. xxxix o! how thy worth with manners may i sing, when thou art all the better part of me? what can mine own praise to mine own self bring? and what ist but mine own when i praise thee? even for this, let us divided live, and our dear love lose name of single one, that by this separation i may give that due to thee which thou deservst alone. o absence! what a torment wouldst thou prove, were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave, to entertain the time with thoughts of love, which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive,   and that thou teachest how to make one twain,   by praising him here who doth hence remain. xl take all my loves, my love, yea take them all; what hast thou then more than thou hadst before? no love, my love, that thou mayst true love call; all mine was thine, before thou hadst this more. then, if for my love, thou my love receivest, i cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest; but yet be blamd, if thou thy self deceivest by wilful taste of what thyself refusest. i do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief, although thou steal thee all my poverty and yet, love knows it is a greater grief to bear loves wrong, than hates known injury.   lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,   kill me with spites yet we must not be foes. xli those pretty wrongs that liberty commits, when i am sometime absent from thy heart, thy beauty, and thy years full well befits, for still temptation follows where thou art. gentle thou art, and therefore to be won, beauteous thou art, therefore to be assaild; and when a woman woos, what womans son will sourly leave her till he have prevaild? ay me! but yet thou mightst my seat forbear, and chide thy beauty and thy straying youth, who lead thee in their riot even there where thou art forced to break a twofold truth   hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,   thine by thy beauty being false to me. xlii that thou hast her it is not all my grief, and yet it may be said i loved her dearly; that she hath thee is of my wailing chief, a loss in love that touches me more nearly. loving offenders thus i will excuse ye thou dost love her, because thou knowst i love her; and for my sake even so doth she abuse me, suffering my friend for my sake to approve her. if i lose thee, my loss is my loves gain, and losing her, my friend hath found that loss; both find each other, and i lose both twain, and both for my sake lay on me this cross   but heres the joy; my friend and i are one;   sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone. xliii when most i wink, then do mine eyes best see, for all the day they view things unrespected; but when i sleep, in dreams they look on thee, and darkly bright, are bright in dark directed. then thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright, how would thy shadows form form happy show to the clear day with thy much clearer light, when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so! how would, i say, mine eyes be blessed made by looking on thee in the living day, when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!   all days are nights to see till i see thee,   and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me. xliv if the dull substance of my flesh were thought, injurious distance should not stop my way; for then despite of space i would be brought, from limits far remote, where thou dost stay. no matter then although my foot did stand upon the farthest earth removd from thee; for nimble thought can jump both sea and land, as soon as think the place where he would be. but, ah! thought kills me that i am not thought, to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone, but that so much of earth and water wrought, i must attend times leisure with my moan;   receiving nought by elements so slow   but heavy tears, badges of eithers woe. xlv the other two, slight air, and purging fire are both with thee, wherever i abide; the first my thought, the other my desire, these presentabsent with swift motion slide. for when these quicker elements are gone in tender embassy of love to thee, my life, being made of four, with two alone sinks down to death, oppressd with melancholy; until lifes composition be recurd by those swift messengers returnd from thee, who even but now come back again, assurd, of thy fair health, recounting it to me   this told, i joy; but then no longer glad,   i send them back again, and straight grow sad. xlvi mine eye and heart are at a mortal war, how to divide the conquest of thy sight; mine eye my heart thy pictures sight would bar, my heart mine eye the freedom of that right. my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie, a closet never piercd with crystal eyes but the defendant doth that plea deny, and says in him thy fair appearance lies. to side this title is impannelled a quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart; and by their verdict is determined the clear eyes moiety, and the dear hearts part   as thus; mine eyes due is thy outward part,   and my hearts right, thy inward love of heart. xlvii betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took, and each doth good turns now unto the other when that mine eye is famishd for a look, or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother, with my loves picture then my eye doth feast, and to the painted banquet bids my heart; another time mine eye is my hearts guest, and in his thoughts of love doth share a part so, either by thy picture or my love, thy self away, art present still with me; for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move, and i am still with them, and they with thee;   or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight   awakes my heart, to hearts and eyes delight. xlviii how careful was i when i took my way, each trifle under truest bars to thrust, that to my use it might unused stay from hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust! but thou, to whom my jewels trifles are, most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief, thou best of dearest, and mine only care, art left the prey of every vulgar thief. thee have i not lockd up in any chest, save where thou art not, though i feel thou art, within the gentle closure of my breast, from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part;   and even thence thou wilt be stoln i fear,   for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear. xlix against that time, if ever that time come, when i shall see thee frown on my defects, when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum, calld to that audit by advisd respects; against that time when thou shalt strangely pass, and scarcely greet me with that sun, thine eye, when love, converted from the thing it was, shall reasons find of settled gravity; against that time do i ensconce me here, within the knowledge of mine own desert, and this my hand, against my self uprear, to guard the lawful reasons on thy part   to leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,   since why to love i can allege no cause. l how heavy do i journey on the way, when what i seek, my weary travels end, doth teach that ease and that repose to say, thus far the miles are measured from thy friend! the beast that bears me, tired with my woe, plods dully on, to bear that weight in me, as if by some instinct the wretch did know his rider lovd not speed, being made from thee the bloody spur cannot provoke him on, that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide, which heavily he answers with a groan, more sharp to me than spurring to his side;   for that same groan doth put this in my mind,   my grief lies onward, and my joy behind. li thus can my love excuse the slow offence of my dull bearer when from thee i speed from where thou art why should i haste me thence? till i return, of posting is no need. o! what excuse will my poor beast then find, when swift extremity can seem but slow? then should i spur, though mounted on the wind, in winged speed no motion shall i know, then can no horse with my desire keep pace; therefore desire, of perfectst love being made, shall neighno dull fleshin his fiery race; but love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,   since from thee going, he went wilfulslow,   towards thee ill run, and give him leave to go. lii so am i as the rich, whose blessed key, can bring him to his sweet uplocked treasure, the which he will not every hour survey, for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure. therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare, since, seldom coming in that long year set, like stones of worth they thinly placed are, or captain jewels in the carcanet. so is the time that keeps you as my chest, or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide, to make some special instant specialblest, by new unfolding his imprisond pride.   blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,   being had, to triumph; being lacked, to hope. liii what is your substance, whereof are you made, that millions of strange shadows on you tend? since every one, hath every one, one shade, and you but one, can every shadow lend. describe adonis, and the counterfeit is poorly imitated after you; on helens cheek all art of beauty set, and you in grecian tires are painted new speak of the spring, and foison of the year, the one doth shadow of your beauty show, the other as your bounty doth appear; and you in every blessed shape we know.   in all external grace you have some part,   but you like none, none you, for constant heart. liv o! how much more doth beauty beauteous seem by that sweet ornament which truth doth give. the rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem for that sweet odour, which doth in it live. the canker blooms have full as deep a dye as the perfumed tincture of the roses. hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly when summers breath their masked buds discloses but, for their virtue only is their show, they live unwood, and unrespected fade; die to themselves. sweet roses do not so; of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made   and so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,   when that shall vade, by verse distills your truth. lv not marble, nor the gilded monuments of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme; but you shall shine more bright in these contents than unswept stone, besmeard with sluttish time. when wasteful war shall statues overturn, and broils root out the work of masonry, nor mars his sword, nor wars quick fire shall burn the living record of your memory. gainst death, and alloblivious enmity shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room even in the eyes of all posterity that wear this world out to the ending doom.   so, till the judgment that yourself arise,   you live in this, and dwell in lovers eyes. lvi sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said thy edge should blunter be than appetite, which but today by feeding is allayd, tomorrow sharpened in his former might so, love, be thou, although today thou fill thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness, tomorrow see again, and do not kill the spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness. let this sad interim like the ocean be which parts the shore, where two contracted new come daily to the banks, that when they see return of love, more blest may be the view;   or call it winter, which being full of care,   makes summers welcome, thrice more wished, more rare. lvii being your slave what should i do but tend, upon the hours, and times of your desire? i have no precious time at all to spend; nor services to do, till you require. nor dare i chide the worldwithoutend hour, whilst i, my sovereign, watch the clock for you, nor think the bitterness of absence sour, when you have bid your servant once adieu; nor dare i question with my jealous thought where you may be, or your affairs suppose, but, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought save, where you are, how happy you make those.   so true a fool is love, that in your will,   though you do anything, he thinks no ill. lviii that god forbid, that made me first your slave, i should in thought control your times of pleasure, or at your hand the account of hours to crave, being your vassal, bound to stay your leisure! o! let me suffer, being at your beck, the imprisond absence of your liberty; and patience, tame to sufferance, bide each check, without accusing you of injury. be where you list, your charter is so strong that you yourself may privilage your time to what you will; to you it doth belong yourself to pardon of selfdoing crime.   i am to wait, though waiting so be hell,   not blame your pleasure be it ill or well. lix if there be nothing new, but that which is hath been before, how are our brains beguild, which labouring for invention bear amiss the second burthen of a former child! o! that record could with a backward look, even of five hundred courses of the sun, show me your image in some antique book, since mind at first in character was done! that i might see what the old world could say to this composed wonder of your frame; whr we are mended, or whr better they, or whether revolution be the same.   o! sure i am the wits of former days,   to subjects worse have given admiring praise. lx like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore, so do our minutes hasten to their end; each changing place with that which goes before, in sequent toil all forwards do contend. nativity, once in the main of light, crawls to maturity, wherewith being crownd, crooked eclipses gainst his glory fight, and time that gave doth now his gift confound. time doth transfix the flourish set on youth and delves the parallels in beautys brow, feeds on the rarities of natures truth, and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow   and yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand.   praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand. lxi is it thy will, thy image should keep open my heavy eyelids to the weary night? dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken, while shadows like to thee do mock my sight? is it thy spirit that thou sendst from thee so far from home into my deeds to pry, to find out shames and idle hours in me, the scope and tenure of thy jealousy? o, no! thy love, though much, is not so great it is my love that keeps mine eye awake mine own true love that doth my rest defeat, to play the watchman ever for thy sake   for thee watch i, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,   from me far off, with others all too near. lxii sin of selflove possesseth all mine eye and all my soul, and all my every part; and for this sin there is no remedy, it is so grounded inward in my heart. methinks no face so gracious is as mine, no shape so true, no truth of such account; and for myself mine own worth do define, as i all other in all worths surmount. but when my glass shows me myself indeed beated and choppd with tanned antiquity, mine own selflove quite contrary i read; self so selfloving were iniquity.   tis thee,myself,that for myself i praise,   painting my age with beauty of thy days. lxiii against my love shall be as i am now, with times injurious hand crushd and oerworn; when hours have draind his blood and filld his brow with lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn hath travelld on to ages steepy night; and all those beauties whereof now hes king are vanishing, or vanished out of sight, stealing away the treasure of his spring; for such a time do i now fortify against confounding ages cruel knife, that he shall never cut from memory my sweet loves beauty, though my lovers life   his beauty shall in these black lines be seen,   and they shall live, and he in them still green. lxiv when i have seen by times fell hand defacd the richproud cost of outworn buried age; when sometime lofty towers i see downrazd, and brass eternal slave to mortal rage; when i have seen the hungry ocean gain advantage on the kingdom of the shore, and the firm soil win of the watery main, increasing store with loss, and loss with store; when i have seen such interchange of state, or state itself confounded, to decay; ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate that time will come and take my love away.   this thought is as a death which cannot choose   but weep to have, that which it fears to lose. lxv since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea, but sad mortality oersways their power, how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea, whose action is no stronger than a flower? o! how shall summers honey breath hold out, against the wrackful siege of battering days, when rocks impregnable are not so stout, nor gates of steel so strong but time decays? o fearful meditation! where, alack, shall times best jewel from times chest lie hid? or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back? or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?   o! none, unless this miracle have might,   that in black ink my love may still shine bright. lxvi tired with all these, for restful death i cry, as to behold desert a beggar born, and needy nothing trimmd in jollity, and purest faith unhappily forsworn, and gilded honour shamefully misplacd, and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted, and right perfection wrongfully disgracd, and strength by limping sway disabled and art made tonguetied by authority, and follydoctorlikecontrolling skill, and simple truth miscalld simplicity, and captive good attending captain ill   tird with all these, from these would i be gone,   save that, to die, i leave my love alone. lxvii ah! wherefore with infection should he live, and with his presence grace impiety, that sin by him advantage should achieve, and lace itself with his society? why should false painting imitate his cheek, and steel dead seeming of his living hue? why should poor beauty indirectly seek roses of shadow, since his rose is true? why should he live, now nature bankrupt is, beggard of blood to blush through lively veins? for she hath no exchequer now but his, and proud of many, lives upon his gains.   o! him she stores, to show what wealth she had   in days long since, before these last so bad. lxviii thus is his cheek the map of days outworn, when beauty lived and died as flowers do now, before these bastard signs of fair were born, or durst inhabit on a living brow; before the golden tresses of the dead, the right of sepulchres, were shorn away, to live a second life on second head; ere beautys dead fleece made another gay in him those holy antique hours are seen, without all ornament, itself and true, making no summer of anothers green, robbing no old to dress his beauty new;   and him as for a map doth nature store,   to show false art what beauty was of yore. lxix those parts of thee that the worlds eye doth view want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend; all tonguesthe voice of soulsgive thee that due, uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend. thy outward thus with outward praise is crownd; but those same tongues, that give thee so thine own, in other accents do this praise confound by seeing farther than the eye hath shown. they look into the beauty of thy mind, and that in guess they measure by thy deeds; thenchurlstheir thoughts, although their eyes were kind, to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds   but why thy odour matcheth not thy show,   the soil is this, that thou dost common grow. lxx that thou art blamd shall not be thy defect, for slanders mark was ever yet the fair; the ornament of beauty is suspect, a crow that flies in heavens sweetest air. so thou be good, slander doth but approve thy worth the greater being wood of time; for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love, and thou presentst a pure unstained prime. thou hast passed by the ambush of young days either not assaild, or victor being chargd; yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise, to tie up envy, evermore enlargd,   if some suspect of ill maskd not thy show,   then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe. lxxi no longer mourn for me when i am dead than you shall hear the surly sullen bell give warning to the world that i am fled from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell nay, if you read this line, remember not the hand that writ it, for i love you so, that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot, if thinking on me then should make you woe. o! if,i say you look upon this verse, when i perhaps compounded am with clay, do not so much as my poor name rehearse; but let your love even with my life decay;   lest the wise world should look into your moan,   and mock you with me after i am gone. lxxii o! lest the world should task you to recite what merit lived in me, that you should love after my death,dear love, forget me quite, for you in me can nothing worthy prove; unless you would devise some virtuous lie, to do more for me than mine own desert, and hang more praise upon deceased i than niggard truth would willingly impart o! lest your true love may seem false in this that you for love speak well of me untrue, my name be buried where my body is, and live no more to shame nor me nor you.   for i am shamed by that which i bring forth,   and so should you, to love things nothing worth. lxxiii that time of year thou mayst in me behold when yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang upon those boughs which shake against the cold, bare ruind choirs, where late the sweet birds sang. in me thou seest the twilight of such day as after sunset fadeth in the west; which by and by black night doth take away, deaths second self, that seals up all in rest. in me thou seest the glowing of such fire, that on the ashes of his youth doth lie, as the deathbed, whereon it must expire, consumd with that which it was nourishd by.   this thou perceivst, which makes thy love more strong,   to love that well, which thou must leave ere long. lxxiv but be contented when that fell arrest without all bail shall carry me away, my life hath in this line some interest, which for memorial still with thee shall stay. when thou reviewest this, thou dost review the very part was consecrate to thee the earth can have but earth, which is his due; my spirit is thine, the better part of me so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life, the prey of worms, my body being dead; the coward conquest of a wretchs knife, too base of thee to be remembered.   the worth of that is that which it contains,   and that is this, and this with thee remains. lxxv so are you to my thoughts as food to life, or as sweetseasond showers are to the ground; and for the peace of you i hold such strife as twixt a miser and his wealth is found. now proud as an enjoyer, and anon doubting the filching age will steal his treasure; now counting best to be with you alone, then betterd that the world may see my pleasure sometime all full with feasting on your sight, and by and by clean starved for a look; possessing or pursuing no delight, save what is had, or must from you be took.   thus do i pine and surfeit day by day,   or gluttoning on all, or all away. lxxvi why is my verse so barren of new pride, so far from variation or quick change? why with the time do i not glance aside to newfound methods, and to compounds strange? why write i still all one, ever the same, and keep invention in a noted weed, that every word doth almost tell my name, showing their birth, and where they did proceed? o! know sweet love i always write of you, and you and love are still my argument; so all my best is dressing old words new, spending again what is already spent   for as the sun is daily new and old,   so is my love still telling what is told. lxxvii thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear, thy dial how thy precious minutes waste; these vacant leaves thy minds imprint will bear, and of this book, this learning mayst thou taste. the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show of mouthed graves will give thee memory; thou by thy dials shady stealth mayst know times thievish progress to eternity. look! what thy memory cannot contain, commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find those children nursed, deliverd from thy brain, to take a new acquaintance of thy mind.   these offices, so oft as thou wilt look,   shall profit thee and much enrich thy book. lxxviii so oft have i invoked thee for my muse, and found such fair assistance in my verse as every alien pen hath got my use and under thee their poesy disperse. thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing and heavy ignorance aloft to fly, have added feathers to the learneds wing and given grace a double majesty. yet be most proud of that which i compile, whose influence is thine, and born of thee in others works thou dost but mend the style, and arts with thy sweet graces graced be;   but thou art all my art, and dost advance   as high as learning, my rude ignorance. lxxix whilst i alone did call upon thy aid, my verse alone had all thy gentle grace; but now my gracious numbers are decayd, and my sick muse doth give an other place. i grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument deserves the travail of a worthier pen; yet what of thee thy poet doth invent he robs thee of, and pays it thee again. he lends thee virtue, and he stole that word from thy behaviour; beauty doth he give, and found it in thy cheek he can afford no praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.   then thank him not for that which he doth say,   since what he owes thee, thou thyself dost pay. lxxx o! how i faint when i of you do write, knowing a better spirit doth use your name, and in the praise thereof spends all his might, to make me tonguetied speaking of your fame! but since your worthwide as the ocean is, the humble as the proudest sail doth bear, my saucy bark, inferior far to his, on your broad main doth wilfully appear. your shallowest help will hold me up afloat, whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride; or, being wrackd, i am a worthless boat, he of tall building, and of goodly pride   then if he thrive and i be cast away,   the worst was this,my love was my decay. lxxxi or i shall live your epitaph to make, or you survive when i in earth am rotten; from hence your memory death cannot take, although in me each part will be forgotten. your name from hence immortal life shall have, though i, once gone, to all the world must die the earth can yield me but a common grave, when you entombed in mens eyes shall lie. your monument shall be my gentle verse, which eyes not yet created shall oerread; and tongues to be, your being shall rehearse, when all the breathers of this world are dead;   you still shall live,such virtue hath my pen,   where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men. lxxxii i grant thou wert not married to my muse, and therefore mayst without attaint oerlook the dedicated words which writers use of their fair subject, blessing every book. thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue, finding thy worth a limit past my praise; and therefore art enforced to seek anew some fresher stamp of the timebettering days. and do so, love; yet when they have devisd, what strained touches rhetoric can lend, thou truly fair, wert truly sympathizd in true plain words, by thy truetelling friend;   and their gross painting might be better usd   where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abusd. lxxxiii i never saw that you did painting need, and therefore to your fair no painting set; i found, or thought i found, you did exceed that barren tender of a poets debt and therefore have i slept in your report, that you yourself, being extant, well might show how far a modern quill doth come too short, speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow. this silence for my sin you did impute, which shall be most my glory being dumb; for i impair not beauty being mute, when others would give life, and bring a tomb.   there lives more life in one of your fair eyes   than both your poets can in praise devise. lxxxiv who is it that says most, which can say more, than this rich praise,that you alone, are you? in whose confine immured is the store which should example where your equal grew. lean penury within that pen doth dwell that to his subject lends not some small glory; but he that writes of you, if he can tell that you are you, so dignifies his story, let him but copy what in you is writ, not making worse what nature made so clear, and such a counterpart shall fame his wit, making his style admired every where.   you to your beauteous blessings add a curse,   being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse. lxxxv my tonguetied muse in manners holds her still, while comments of your praise richly compild, reserve their character with golden quill, and precious phrase by all the muses fild. i think good thoughts, whilst others write good words, and like unlettered clerk still cry amen to every hymn that able spirit affords, in polishd form of wellrefined pen. hearing you praised, i say tis so, tis true, and to the most of praise add something more; but that is in my thought, whose love to you, though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.   then others, for the breath of words respect,   me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect. lxxxvi was it the proud full sail of his great verse, bound for the prize of all too precious you, that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse, making their tomb the womb wherein they grew? was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write, above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead? no, neither he, nor his compeers by night giving him aid, my verse astonished. he, nor that affable familiar ghost which nightly gulls him with intelligence, as victors of my silence cannot boast; i was not sick of any fear from thence   but when your countenance filld up his line,   then lacked i matter; that enfeebled mine. lxxxvii farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing, and like enough thou knowst thy estimate, the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing; my bonds in thee are all determinate. for how do i hold thee but by thy granting? and for that riches where is my deserving? the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting, and so my patent back again is swerving. thy self thou gavst, thy own worth then not knowing, or me to whom thou gavst it, else mistaking; so thy great gift, upon misprision growing, comes home again, on better judgement making.   thus have i had thee, as a dream doth flatter,   in sleep a king, but waking no such matter. lxxxviii when thou shalt be disposd to set me light, and place my merit in the eye of scorn, upon thy side, against myself ill fight, and prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn. with mine own weakness, being best acquainted, upon thy part i can set down a story of faults conceald, wherein i am attainted; that thou in losing me shalt win much glory and i by this will be a gainer too; for bending all my loving thoughts on thee, the injuries that to myself i do, doing thee vantage, doublevantage me.   such is my love, to thee i so belong,   that for thy right, myself will bear all wrong. lxxxix say that thou didst forsake me for some fault, and i will comment upon that offence speak of my lameness, and i straight will halt, against thy reasons making no defence. thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill, to set a form upon desired change, as ill myself disgrace; knowing thy will, i will acquaintance strangle, and look strange; be absent from thy walks; and in my tongue thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell, lest i, too much profane, should do it wrong, and haply of our old acquaintance tell.   for thee, against my self ill vow debate,   for i must neer love him whom thou dost hate. xc then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now; now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross, join with the spite of fortune, make me bow, and do not drop in for an afterloss ah! do not, when my heart hath scapd this sorrow, come in the rearward of a conquerd woe; give not a windy night a rainy morrow, to linger out a purposd overthrow. if thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last, when other petty griefs have done their spite, but in the onset come so shall i taste at first the very worst of fortunes might;   and other strains of woe, which now seem woe,   compard with loss of thee, will not seem so. xci some glory in their birth, some in their skill, some in their wealth, some in their bodys force, some in their garments though newfangled ill; some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse; and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure, wherein it finds a joy above the rest but these particulars are not my measure, all these i better in one general best. thy love is better than high birth to me, richer than wealth, prouder than garments costs, of more delight than hawks and horses be; and having thee, of all mens pride i boast   wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take   all this away, and me most wretchcd make. xcii but do thy worst to steal thyself away, for term of life thou art assured mine; and life no longer than thy love will stay, for it depends upon that love of thine. then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs, when in the least of them my life hath end. i see a better state to me belongs than that which on thy humour doth depend thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind, since that my life on thy revolt doth lie. o! what a happy title do i find, happy to have thy love, happy to die!   but whats so blessedfair that fears no blot?   thou mayst be false, and yet i know it not. xciii so shall i live, supposing thou art true, like a deceived husband; so loves face may still seem love to me, though alterd new; thy looks with me, thy heart in other place for there can live no hatred in thine eye, therefore in that i cannot know thy change. in manys looks, the false hearts history is writ in moods, and frowns, and wrinkles strange. but heaven in thy creation did decree that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell; whateer thy thoughts, or thy hearts workings be, thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.   how like eves apple doth thy beauty grow,   if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show! xciv they that have power to hurt, and will do none, that do not do the thing they most do show, who, moving others, are themselves as stone, unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow; they rightly do inherit heavens graces, and husband natures riches from expense; they are the lords and owners of their faces, others, but stewards of their excellence. the summers flower is to the summer sweet, though to itself, it only live and die, but if that flower with base infection meet, the basest weed outbraves his dignity   for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;   lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds. xcv how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame which, like a canker in the fragrant rose, doth spot the beauty of thy budding name! o! in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose. that tongue that tells the story of thy days, making lascivious comments on thy sport, cannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise; naming thy name, blesses an ill report. o! what a mansion have those vices got which for their habitation chose out thee, where beautys veil doth cover every blot and all things turns to fair that eyes can see!   take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege;   the hardest knife illusd doth lose his edge. xcvi some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness; some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport; both grace and faults are lovd of more and less thou makst faults graces that to thee resort. as on the finger of a throned queen the basest jewel will be well esteemd, so are those errors that in thee are seen to truths translated, and for true things deemd. how many lambs might the stern wolf betray, if like a lamb he could his looks translate! how many gazers mightst thou lead away, if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!   but do not so; i love thee in such sort,   as, thou being mine, mine is thy good report. xcvii how like a winter hath my absence been from thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year! what freezings have i felt, what dark days seen! what old decembers bareness everywhere! and yet this time removed was summers time; the teeming autumn, big with rich increase, bearing the wanton burden of the prime, like widowd wombs after their lords decease yet this abundant issue seemd to me but hope of orphans, and unfatherd fruit; for summer and his pleasures wait on thee, and, thou away, the very birds are mute   or, if they sing, tis with so dull a cheer,   that leaves look pale, dreading the winters near. xcviii from you have i been absent in the spring, when proudpied april, dressd in all his trim, hath put a spirit of youth in every thing, that heavy saturn laughd and leapd with him. yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell of different flowers in odour and in hue, could make me any summers story tell, or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew nor did i wonder at the lilys white, nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose; they were but sweet, but figures of delight, drawn after you, you pattern of all those.   yet seemd it winter still, and you away,   as with your shadow i with these did play. xcix the forward violet thus did i chide sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells, if not from my loves breath? the purple pride which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells in my loves veins thou hast too grossly dyd. the lily i condemned for thy hand, and buds of marjoram had stoln thy hair; the roses fearfully on thorns did stand, one blushing shame, another white despair; a third, nor red nor white, had stoln of both, and to his robbery had annexd thy breath; but, for his theft, in pride of all his growth a vengeful canker eat him up to death.   more flowers i noted, yet i none could see,   but sweet, or colour it had stoln from thee. c where art thou muse that thou forgetst so long, to speak of that which gives thee all thy might? spendst thou thy fury on some worthless song, darkening thy power to lend base subjects light? return forgetful muse, and straight redeem, in gentle numbers time so idly spent; sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem and gives thy pen both skill and argument. rise, resty muse, my loves sweet face survey, if time have any wrinkle graven there; if any, be a satire to decay, and make times spoils despised every where.   give my love fame faster than time wastes life,   so thou preventst his scythe and crooked knife. ci o truant muse what shall be thy amends for thy neglect of truth in beauty dyd? both truth and beauty on my love depends; so dost thou too, and therein dignified. make answer muse wilt thou not haply say, truth needs no colour, with his colour fixd; beauty no pencil, beautys truth to lay; but best is best, if never intermixd? because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb? excuse not silence so, fort lies in thee to make him much outlive a gilded tomb and to be praisd of ages yet to be.   then do thy office, muse; i teach thee how   to make him seem long hence as he shows now. cii my love is strengthend, though more weak in seeming; i love not less, though less the show appear; that love is merchandizd, whose rich esteeming, the owners tongue doth publish every where. our love was new, and then but in the spring, when i was wont to greet it with my lays; as philomel in summers front doth sing, and stops her pipe in growth of riper days not that the summer is less pleasant now than when her mournful hymns did hush the night, but that wild music burthens every bough, and sweets grown common lose their dear delight.   therefore like her, i sometime hold my tongue   because i would not dull you with my song. ciii alack! what poverty my muse brings forth, that having such a scope to show her pride, the argument, all bare, is of more worth than when it hath my added praise beside! o! blame me not, if i no more can write! look in your glass, and there appears a face that overgoes my blunt invention quite, dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace. were it not sinful then, striving to mend, to mar the subject that before was well? for to no other pass my verses tend than of your graces and your gifts to tell;   and more, much more, than in my verse can sit,   your own glass shows you when you look in it. civ to me, fair friend, you never can be old, for as you were when first your eye i eyd, such seems your beauty still. three winters cold, have from the forests shook three summers pride, three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turnd, in process of the seasons have i seen, three april perfumes in three hot junes burnd, since first i saw you fresh, which yet are green. ah! yet doth beauty like a dialhand, steal from his figure, and no pace perceivd; so your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand, hath motion, and mine eye may be deceivd   for fear of which, hear this thou age unbred   ere you were born was beautys summer dead. cv let not my love be calld idolatry, nor my beloved as an idol show, since all alike my songs and praises be to one, of one, still such, and ever so. kind is my love today, tomorrow kind, still constant in a wondrous excellence; therefore my verse to constancy confind, one thing expressing, leaves out difference. fair, kind, and true, is all my argument, fair, kind, and true, varying to other words; and in this change is my invention spent, three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.   fair, kind, and true, have often livd alone,   which three till now, never kept seat in one. cvi when in the chronicle of wasted time i see descriptions of the fairest wights, and beauty making beautiful old rime, in praise of ladies dead and lovely knights, then, in the blazon of sweet beautys best, of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow, i see their antique pen would have expressd even such a beauty as you master now. so all their praises are but prophecies of this our time, all you prefiguring; and for they looked but with divining eyes, they had not skill enough your worth to sing   for we, which now behold these present days,   have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise. cvii not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul of the wide world dreaming on things to come, can yet the lease of my true love control, supposed as forfeit to a confind doom. the mortal moon hath her eclipse endurd, and the sad augurs mock their own presage; incertainties now crown themselves assurd, and peace proclaims olives of endless age. now with the drops of this most balmy time, my love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes, since, spite of him, ill live in this poor rime, while he insults oer dull and speechless tribes   and thou in this shalt find thy monument,   when tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent. cviii whats in the brain, that ink may character, which hath not figurd to thee my true spirit? whats new to speak, what now to register, that may express my love, or thy dear merit? nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine, i must each day say oer the very same; counting no old thing old, thou mine, i thine, even as when first i hallowd thy fair name. so that eternal love in loves fresh case, weighs not the dust and injury of age, nor gives to necessary wrinkles place, but makes antiquity for aye his page;   finding the first conceit of love there bred,   where time and outward form would show it dead. cix o! never say that i was false of heart, though absence seemd my flame to qualify, as easy might i from my self depart as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie that is my home of love if i have rangd, like him that travels, i return again; just to the time, not with the time exchangd, so that myself bring water for my stain. never believe though in my nature reignd, all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood, that it could so preposterously be staind, to leave for nothing all thy sum of good;   for nothing this wide universe i call,   save thou, my rose, in it thou art my all. cx alas! tis true, i have gone here and there, and made my self a motley to the view, gord mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear, made old offences of affections new; most true it is, that i have lookd on truth askance and strangely; but, by all above, these blenches gave my heart another youth, and worse essays provd thee my best of love. now all is done, save what shall have no end mine appetite i never more will grind on newer proof, to try an older friend, a god in love, to whom i am confind.   then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,   even to thy pure and most most loving breast. cxi o! for my sake do you with fortune chide, the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds, that did not better for my life provide than public means which public manners breeds. thence comes it that my name receives a brand, and almost thence my nature is subdud to what it works in, like the dyers hand pity me, then, and wish i were renewd; whilst, like a willing patient, i will drink, potions of eisel gainst my strong infection; no bitterness that i will bitter think, nor double penance, to correct correction.   pity me then, dear friend, and i assure ye,   even that your pity is enough to cure me. cxii your love and pity doth the impression fill, which vulgar scandal stampd upon my brow; for what care i who calls me well or ill, so you oergreen my bad, my good allow? you are my alltheworld, and i must strive to know my shames and praises from your tongue; none else to me, nor i to none alive, that my steeld sense or changes right or wrong. in so profound abysm i throw all care of others voices, that my adders sense to critic and to flatterer stopped are. mark how with my neglect i do dispense   you are so strongly in my purpose bred,   that all the world besides methinks are dead. cxiii since i left you, mine eye is in my mind; and that which governs me to go about doth part his function and is partly blind, seems seeing, but effectually is out; for it no form delivers to the heart of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch of his quick objects hath the mind no part, nor his own vision holds what it doth catch; for if it see the rudst or gentlest sight, the most sweet favour or deformedst creature, the mountain or the sea, the day or night the crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature.   incapable of more, replete with you,   my most true mind thus maketh mine untrue. cxiv or whether doth my mind, being crownd with you, drink up the monarchs plague, this flattery? or whether shall i say, mine eye saith true, and that your love taught it this alchemy, to make of monsters and things indigest such cherubins as your sweet self resemble, creating every bad a perfect best, as fast as objects to his beams assemble? o! tis the first, tis flattery in my seeing, and my great mind most kingly drinks it up mine eye well knows what with his gust is greeing, and to his palate doth prepare the cup   if it be poisond, tis the lesser sin   that mine eye loves it and doth first begin. cxv those lines that i before have writ do lie, even those that said i could not love you dearer yet then my judgment knew no reason why my most full flame should afterwards burn clearer. but reckoning time, whose milliond accidents creep in twixt vows, and change decrees of kings, tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharpst intents, divert strong minds to the course of altering things; alas! why fearing of times tyranny, might i not then say, now i love you best, when i was certain oer incertainty, crowning the present, doubting of the rest?   love is a babe, then might i not say so,   to give full growth to that which still doth grow? cxvi let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments. love is not love which alters when it alteration finds, or bends with the remover to remove o, no! it is an everfixed mark, that looks on tempests and is never shaken; it is the star to every wandering bark, whose worths unknown, although his height be taken. loves not times fool, though rosy lips and cheeks within his bending sickles compass come; love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, but bears it out even to the edge of doom.   if this be error and upon me provd,   i never writ, nor no man ever lovd. cxvii accuse me thus that i have scanted all, wherein i should your great deserts repay, forgot upon your dearest love to call, whereto all bonds do tie me day by day; that i have frequent been with unknown minds, and given to time your own dearpurchasd right; that i have hoisted sail to all the winds which should transport me farthest from your sight. book both my wilfulness and errors down, and on just proof surmise, accumulate; bring me within the level of your frown, but shoot not at me in your wakend hate;   since my appeal says i did strive to prove   the constancy and virtue of your love. cxviii like as, to make our appetite more keen, with eager compounds we our palate urge; as, to prevent our maladies unseen, we sicken to shun sickness when we purge; even so, being full of your neercloying sweetness, to bitter sauces did i frame my feeding; and, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness to be diseasd, ere that there was true needing. thus policy in love, to anticipate the ills that were not, grew to faults assurd, and brought to medicine a healthful state which, rank of goodness, would by ill be curd;   but thence i learn and find the lesson true,   drugs poison him that so fell sick of you. cxix what potions have i drunk of siren tears, distilld from limbecks foul as hell within, applying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears, still losing when i saw myself to win! what wretched errors hath my heart committed, whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never! how have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted, in the distraction of this madding fever! o benefit of ill! now i find true that better is, by evil still made better; and ruind love, when it is built anew, grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.   so i return rebukd to my content,   and gain by ill thrice more than i have spent. cxx that you were once unkind befriends me now, and for that sorrow, which i then did feel, needs must i under my transgression bow, unless my nerves were brass or hammerd steel. for if you were by my unkindness shaken, as i by yours, youve passd a hell of time; and i, a tyrant, have no leisure taken to weigh how once i sufferd in your crime. o! that our night of woe might have rememberd my deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits, and soon to you, as you to me, then tenderd the humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits!   but that your trespass now becomes a fee;   mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me. cxxi tis better to be vile than vile esteemd, when not to be receives reproach of being; and the just pleasure lost, which is so deemd not by our feeling, but by others seeing for why should others false adulterate eyes give salutation to my sportive blood? or on my frailties why are frailer spies, which in their wills count bad what i think good? no, i am that i am, and they that level at my abuses reckon up their own i may be straight though they themselves be bevel; by their rank thoughts, my deeds must not be shown;   unless this general evil they maintain,   all men are bad and in their badness reign. cxxii thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain full characterd with lasting memory, which shall above that idle rank remain, beyond all date; even to eternity or, at the least, so long as brain and heart have faculty by nature to subsist; till each to razd oblivion yield his part of thee, thy record never can be missd. that poor retention could not so much hold, nor need i tallies thy dear love to score; therefore to give them from me was i bold, to trust those tables that receive thee more   to keep an adjunct to remember thee   were to import forgetfulness in me. cxxiii no, time, thou shalt not boast that i do change thy pyramids built up with newer might to me are nothing novel, nothing strange; they are but dressings of a former sight. our dates are brief, and therefore we admire what thou dost foist upon us that is old; and rather make them born to our desire than think that we before have heard them told. thy registers and thee i both defy, not wondering at the present nor the past, for thy records and what we see doth lie, made more or less by thy continual haste.   this i do vow and this shall ever be;   i will be true despite thy scythe and thee. cxxiv if my dear love were but the child of state, it might for fortunes bastard be unfatherd, as subject to times love or to times hate, weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gatherd. no, it was builded far from accident; it suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls under the blow of thralled discontent, whereto th inviting time our fashion calls it fears not policy, that heretic, which works on leases of shortnumberd hours, but all alone stands hugely politic, that it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers.   to this i witness call the fools of time,   which die for goodness, who have lived for crime. cxxv weret aught to me i bore the canopy, with my extern the outward honouring, or laid great bases for eternity, which proves more short than waste or ruining? have i not seen dwellers on form and favour lose all and more by paying too much rent for compound sweet; forgoing simple savour, pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent? no; let me be obsequious in thy heart, and take thou my oblation, poor but free, which is not mixd with seconds, knows no art, but mutual render, only me for thee.   hence, thou suborned informer! a true soul   when most impeachd, stands least in thy control. cxxvi o thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power dost hold times fickle glass, his fickle hour; who hast by waning grown, and therein showst thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self growst. if nature, sovereign mistress over wrack, as thou goest onwards, still will pluck thee back, she keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill may time disgrace and wretched minutes kill. yet fear her, o thou minion of her pleasure! she may detain, but not still keep, her treasure   her audit (though delayed) answered must be,   and her quietus is to render thee. cxxvii in the old age black was not counted fair, or if it were, it bore not beautys name; but now is black beautys successive heir, and beauty slanderd with a bastard shame for since each hand hath put on natures power, fairing the foul with arts false borrowed face, sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower, but is profand, if not lives in disgrace. therefore my mistress eyes are raven black, her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem at such who, not born fair, no beauty lack, slandring creation with a false esteem   yet so they mourn becoming of their woe,   that every tongue says beauty should look so. cxxviii how oft when thou, my music, music playst, upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds with thy sweet fingers when thou gently swayst the wiry concord that mine ear confounds, do i envy those jacks that nimble leap, to kiss the tender inward of thy hand, whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap, at the woods boldness by thee blushing stand! to be so tickled, they would change their state and situation with those dancing chips, oer whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait, making dead wood more blessd than living lips.   since saucy jacks so happy are in this,   give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss. cxxix the expense of spirit in a waste of shame is lust in action and till action, lust is perjurd, murderous, bloody, full of blame, savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust; enjoyd no sooner but despised straight; past reason hunted; and no sooner had, past reason hated, as a swallowd bait, on purpose laid to make the taker mad mad in pursuit and in possession so; had, having, and in quest, to have extreme; a bliss in proof, and provd, a very woe; before, a joy proposd; behind a dream.   all this the world well knows; yet none knows well   to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell. cxxx my mistress eyes are nothing like the sun; coral is far more red, than her lips red if snow be white, why then her breasts are dun; if hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head. i have seen roses damaskd, red and white, but no such roses see i in her cheeks; and in some perfumes is there more delight than in the breath that from my mistress reeks. i love to hear her speak, yet well i know that music hath a far more pleasing sound i grant i never saw a goddess go, my mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground   and yet by heaven, i think my love as rare,   as any she belied with false compare. cxxxi thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art, as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel; for well thou knowst to my dear doting heart thou art the fairest and most precious jewel. yet, in good faith, some say that thee behold, thy face hath not the power to make love groan; to say they err i dare not be so bold, although i swear it to myself alone. and to be sure that is not false i swear, a thousand groans, but thinking on thy face, one on anothers neck, do witness bear thy black is fairest in my judgments place.   in nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,   and thence this slander, as i think, proceeds. cxxxii thine eyes i love, and they, as pitying me, knowing thy heart torment me with disdain, have put on black and loving mourners be, looking with pretty ruth upon my pain. and truly not the morning sun of heaven better becomes the grey cheeks of the east, nor that full star that ushers in the even, doth half that glory to the sober west, as those two mourning eyes become thy face o! let it then as well beseem thy heart to mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace, and suit thy pity like in every part.   then will i swear beauty herself is black,   and all they foul that thy complexion lack. cxxxiii beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan for that deep wound it gives my friend and me! ist not enough to torture me alone, but slave to slavery my sweetst friend must be? me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken, and my next self thou harder hast engrossd of him, myself, and thee i am forsaken; a torment thrice threefold thus to be crossd prison my heart in thy steel bosoms ward, but then my friends heart let my poor heart bail; whoeer keeps me, let my heart be his guard; thou canst not then use rigour in my jail   and yet thou wilt; for i, being pent in thee,   perforce am thine, and all that is in me. cxxxiv so, now i have confessd that he is thine, and i my self am mortgagd to thy will, myself ill forfeit, so that other mine thou wilt restore to be my comfort still but thou wilt not, nor he will not be free, for thou art covetous, and he is kind; he learnd but suretylike to write for me, under that bond that him as fast doth bind. the statute of thy beauty thou wilt take, thou usurer, that puttst forth all to use, and sue a friend came debtor for my sake; so him i lose through my unkind abuse.   him have i lost; thou hast both him and me   he pays the whole, and yet am i not free. cxxxv whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will, and will to boot, and will in overplus; more than enough am i that vexd thee still, to thy sweet will making addition thus. wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious, not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine? shall will in others seem right gracious, and in my will no fair acceptance shine? the sea, all water, yet receives rain still, and in abundance addeth to his store; so thou, being rich in will, add to thy will one will of mine, to make thy large will more.   let no unkind no fair beseechers kill;   think all but one, and me in that one will. cxxxvi if thy soul check thee that i come so near, swear to thy blind soul that i was thy will, and will, thy soul knows, is admitted there; thus far for love, my lovesuit, sweet, fulfil. will, will fulfil the treasure of thy love, ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one. in things of great receipt with ease we prove among a number one is reckond none then in the number let me pass untold, though in thy stores account i one must be; for nothing hold me, so it please thee hold that nothing me, a something sweet to thee   make but my name thy love, and love that still,   and then thou lovst me for my name is will. cxxxvii thou blind fool, love, what dost thou to mine eyes, that they behold, and see not what they see? they know what beauty is, see where it lies, yet what the best is take the worst to be. if eyes, corrupt by overpartial looks, be anchord in the bay where all men ride, why of eyes falsehood hast thou forged hooks, whereto the judgment of my heart is tied? why should my heart think that a several plot, which my heart knows the wide worlds common place? or mine eyes, seeing this, say this is not, to put fair truth upon so foul a face?   in things right true my heart and eyes have errd,   and to this false plague are they now transferrd. cxxxviii when my love swears that she is made of truth, i do believe her though i know she lies, that she might think me some untutord youth, unlearned in the worlds false subtleties. thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young, although she knows my days are past the best, simply i credit her falsespeaking tongue on both sides thus is simple truth suppressed but wherefore says she not she is unjust? and wherefore say not i that i am old? o! loves best habit is in seeming trust, and age in love, loves not to have years told   therefore i lie with her, and she with me,   and in our faults by lies we flatterd be. cxxxix o! call not me to justify the wrong that thy unkindness lays upon my heart; wound me not with thine eye, but with thy tongue use power with power, and slay me not by art, tell me thou lovst elsewhere; but in my sight, dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside what needst thou wound with cunning, when thy might is more than my oerpressd defence can bide? let me excuse thee ah! my love well knows her pretty looks have been mine enemies; and therefore from my face she turns my foes, that they elsewhere might dart their injuries   yet do not so; but since i am near slain,   kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain. cxl be wise as thou art cruel; do not press my tonguetied patience with too much disdain; lest sorrow lend me words, and words express the manner of my pitywanting pain. if i might teach thee wit, better it were, though not to love, yet, love to tell me so; as testy sick men, when their deaths be near, no news but health from their physicians know; for, if i should despair, i should grow mad, and in my madness might speak ill of thee; now this illwresting world is grown so bad, mad slanderers by mad ears believed be.   that i may not be so, nor thou belied,   bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide. cxli in faith i do not love thee with mine eyes, for they in thee a thousand errors note; but tis my heart that loves what they despise, who, in despite of view, is pleased to dote. nor are mine ears with thy tongues tune delighted; nor tender feeling, to base touches prone, nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited to any sensual feast with thee alone but my five wits nor my five senses can dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee, who leaves unswayd the likeness of a man, thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be   only my plague thus far i count my gain,   that she that makes me sin awards me pain. cxlii love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate, hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving o! but with mine compare thou thine own state, and thou shalt find it merits not reproving; or, if it do, not from those lips of thine, that have profand their scarlet ornaments and seald false bonds of love as oft as mine, robbd others beds revenues of their rents. be it lawful i love thee, as thou lovst those whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee root pity in thy heart, that, when it grows, thy pity may deserve to pitied be.   if thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,   by selfexample mayst thou be denied! cxliii lo, as a careful housewife runs to catch one of her featherd creatures broke away, sets down her babe, and makes all swift dispatch in pursuit of the thing she would have stay; whilst her neglected child holds her in chase, cries to catch her whose busy care is bent to follow that which flies before her face, not prizing her poor infants discontent; so runnst thou after that which flies from thee, whilst i thy babe chase thee afar behind; but if thou catch thy hope, turn back to me, and play the mothers part, kiss me, be kind;   so will i pray that thou mayst have thy will,   if thou turn back and my loud crying still. cxliv two loves i have of comfort and despair, which like two spirits do suggest me still the better angel is a man right fair, the worser spirit a woman colourd ill. to win me soon to hell, my female evil, tempteth my better angel from my side, and would corrupt my saint to be a devil, wooing his purity with her foul pride. and whether that my angel be turnd fiend, suspect i may, yet not directly tell; but being both from me, both to each friend, i guess one angel in anothers hell   yet this shall i neer know, but live in doubt,   till my bad angel fire my good one out. cxlv those lips that loves own hand did make, breathed forth the sound that said i hate, to me that languishd for her sake but when she saw my woeful state, straight in her heart did mercy come, chiding that tongue that ever sweet was usd in giving gentle doom; and taught it thus anew to greet; i hate she alterd with an end, that followed it as gentle day, doth follow night, who like a fiend from heaven to hell is flown away.   i hate, from hate away she threw,   and savd my life, saying not you. cxlvi poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth, my sinful earth these rebel powers array, why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth, painting thy outward walls so costly gay? why so large cost, having so short a lease, dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend? shall worms, inheritors of this excess, eat up thy charge? is this thy bodys end? then soul, live thou upon thy servants loss, and let that pine to aggravate thy store; buy terms divine in selling hours of dross; within be fed, without be rich no more   so shall thou feed on death, that feeds on men,   and death once dead, theres no more dying then. cxlvii my love is as a fever longing still, for that which longer nurseth the disease; feeding on that which doth preserve the ill, the uncertain sickly appetite to please. my reason, the physician to my love, angry that his prescriptions are not kept, hath left me, and i desperate now approve desire is death, which physic did except. past cure i am, now reason is past care, and franticmad with evermore unrest; my thoughts and my discourse as madmens are, at random from the truth vainly expressd;   for i have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,   who art as black as hell, as dark as night. cxlviii o me! what eyes hath love put in my head, which have no correspondence with true sight; or, if they have, where is my judgment fled, that censures falsely what they see aright? if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote, what means the world to say it is not so? if it be not, then love doth well denote loves eye is not so true as all mens no, how can it? o! how can loves eye be true, that is so vexed with watching and with tears? no marvel then, though i mistake my view; the sun itself sees not, till heaven clears.   o cunning love! with tears thou keepst me blind,   lest eyes wellseeing thy foul faults should find. cxlix canst thou, o cruel! say i love thee not, when i against myself with thee partake? do i not think on thee, when i forgot am of my self, all tyrant, for thy sake? who hateth thee that i do call my friend, on whom frownst thou that i do fawn upon, nay, if thou lourst on me, do i not spend revenge upon myself with present moan? what merit do i in my self respect, that is so proud thy service to despise, when all my best doth worship thy defect, commanded by the motion of thine eyes?   but, love, hate on, for now i know thy mind;   those that can see thou lovst, and i am blind. cl o! from what power hast thou this powerful might, with insufficiency my heart to sway? to make me give the lie to my true sight, and swear that brightness doth not grace the day? whence hast thou this becoming of things ill, that in the very refuse of thy deeds there is such strength and warrantise of skill, that, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds? who taught thee how to make me love thee more, the more i hear and see just cause of hate? o! though i love what others do abhor, with others thou shouldst not abhor my state   if thy unworthiness raisd love in me,   more worthy i to be belovd of thee. cli love is too young to know what conscience is, yet who knows not conscience is born of love? then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss, lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove for, thou betraying me, i do betray my nobler part to my gross bodys treason; my soul doth tell my body that he may triumph in love; flesh stays no farther reason, but rising at thy name doth point out thee, as his triumphant prize. proud of this pride, he is contented thy poor drudge to be, to stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.   no want of conscience hold it that i call   her love, for whose dear love i rise and fall. clii in loving thee thou knowst i am forsworn, but thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing; in act thy bedvow broke, and new faith torn, in vowing new hate after new love bearing but why of two oaths breach do i accuse thee, when i break twenty? i am perjurd most; for all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee, and all my honest faith in thee is lost for i have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness, oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy; and, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness, or made them swear against the thing they see;   for i have sworn thee fair; more perjurd i,   to swear against the truth so foul a lie! cliii cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep a maid of dians this advantage found, and his lovekindling fire did quickly steep in a cold valleyfountain of that ground; which borrowd from this holy fire of love, a dateless lively heat, still to endure, and grew a seeting bath, which yet men prove against strange maladies a sovereign cure. but at my mistress eye loves brand newfired, the boy for trial needs would touch my breast; i, sick withal, the help of bath desired, and thither hied, a sad distemperd guest,   but found no cure, the bath for my help lies   where cupid got new fire; my mistress eyes. cliv the little lovegod lying once asleep, laid by his side his heartinflaming brand, whilst many nymphs that vowd chaste life to keep came tripping by; but in her maiden hand the fairest votary took up that fire which many legions of true hearts had warmd; and so the general of hot desire was, sleeping, by a virgin hand disarmd. this brand she quenched in a cool well by, which from loves fire took heat perpetual, growing a bath and healthful remedy, for men diseasd; but i, my mistress thrall,   came there for cure and this by that i prove,   loves fire heats water, water cools not love.'"
